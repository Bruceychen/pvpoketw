    Elite TM - 厲害招式學習器(含厲害一般招式學習器與厲害特殊招式學習器)可以讓寶可夢直接學習指定的特定招式或絕版招式，通常可以透過在 GO 對戰聯盟(俗稱天梯) 中達到R7以上等級，進而在賽季末獎勵中取得，或是在社群日購買特別禮盒獲得。這些厲害招式學習器也讓寶可夢的招式組變得更加多元！在這篇文章中,我們將談談該如何運用與選擇，好讓你包包內的厲害招式學習器發揮最大價值！
</p>
<p>
    提醒您，並非所有舊版/絕版招式皆能透過厲害招式學習器習得！例如關東地區隆隆岩、三地鼠便無法藉由厲害招式學習器學會已絕版的泥巴射擊。另外請注意的是，厲害招式學習器在一般狀況下(非官方活動進行期間)，不能用以消除暗影寶可夢的"遷怒"，也無法學會"報恩"。

  <a name="groudon"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">固拉多 (Groudon)</h3>
<div class="article-section">
<p>
  <strong>推薦招式：</strong>
   泥巴射擊
  + <em>火焰拳</em> &amp; 地震
  <em>
	  <br/>
  </em>
  <strong>適用於：</strong>
  大師聯盟(CP無限制)
</p>
<p>
    火焰拳給了固拉多一個很大的優勢。一個只需要25能量的特殊招式，比它過往最快的招式 地震(65能量)快上更多，還能有效克制大師聯盟中頻繁出現的鋼屬性寶可夢meta。
</p>
<p>
    火焰拳一個很重要的功能是"騙盾"(shield bait)的能力。<b>學會火焰拳的固拉多將有能力透過成功騙盾，而擊敗始源與別種騎拉帝納</b>。
    它也可以在僅使用火焰拳的極端狀況下險勝帝牙盧卡和波克基斯<b>(因帝牙盧卡尚需要 1次 龍息才能發出 鐵頭, 而波克基斯則可以選擇在完全不用特殊招式下僅用一般招式獲勝)。</b>
</p>
<p>
    如果你已經擁有完成強化的固拉多，使用厲害招式學習器讓它學會火焰拳會是很划算的投資！此舉亦大大提高了固拉多的生存能力。<b>但由於目前尚未開放固拉多的招牌專屬招式"斷崖之劍"</b>，因此如果你現在就想投資固拉多，則須做好未來必須使用更多厲害招式學習器在固拉多身上的心理準備。
</p>
  </div>

  <a name="cresselia"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">克雷色利亞 (Cresselia)</h3>
<div class="article-section">
<p>
  <strong>推薦招式：</strong>
    精神利刃 或 念力
  + <em>打草結</em> &amp; 月亮之力
  <em>
	  <br/>
  </em>
  <strong>適用於：</strong>
    超級聯盟(CP1500)
</p>
<p>
    超級聯盟充斥者許多水屬性寶可夢，常見如瑪力露麗和巨沼怪，它們是隊伍中的中堅力量。學習到打草結的克雷色利亞能有效在戰鬥中，<b>壓制並擊敗瑪力露麗、鯰魚王、巨沼怪，和白海獅。</b>他還可以擊敗許多草系寶可夢，例如妙蛙花和熱帶龍等，以及格鬥系的寶可夢，如毒骷蛙、恰雷姆等和偽格鬥寶可夢，如防禦型代歐奇希斯和過動猿等。
</p>
<p>
    打草結通常與月亮之力搭配使用，他使克雷色利亞可以對抗惡屬性寶可夢例如月亮伊布、頭巾混混。對於快速招式精神利刃和念力的選擇，取決於你想如何的使用克雷色利亞。念力傷害量高(尤其對付帶有毒屬性及格鬥屬性的寶可夢更是如此)，而精神利刃給予了克雷色利亞在擋切及蓄能上更大的靈活度。對於精神利刃和念力選擇可能取決於你的團隊組成，比如你需要使用克雷色利亞對抗惡屬性寶可夢。
</p>
<p>
    超級聯盟(CP1500)中推薦用打草結，但在一般情況下月亮之力和預知未來通常是標配。

  <h3 class="article-header">Dewgong</h3>
  <div class="article-section">
  <p>
  <strong>Moveset: </strong>
  <em>Ice Shard</em>
  + <em>Icy Wind</em> &amp; Water Pulse
  <em>
  	<br/>
  </em>
  <strong>Formats: </strong>
  Great League
  </p>
  <p>
  If you’ve been playing Great League or in The Silph Arena for a while,
  you’ve probably heard myths about this rare creature. You’ve maybe even
  glimpsed one for 4 whole minutes before the game timed out. The fabled
  double legacy Dewgong is available via Elite TM, but comes at the steep
  cost of two TM's if you don’t have one of the legacy moves already.
  </p>
  <p>
  Make no mistake,    <strong>double legacy Dewgong is a top tier Great League Pokemon </strong>
  that combines great bulk with a stat-lowering move that is both spammable
  and powerful. Unlike comparable moves like Bubble Beam and Sand Tomb, Icy
  Wind boasts decent damage. Even in losing matchups, Icy Wind draws
  opponents into extended fights where they may lose the battle as well as
  their cool.
  </p>
  <p>
  One challenge is <strong>Dewgong can be difficult to build a team around</strong>, especially in GO Battle League. Dewgong is vulnerable to Counter users, Rock Slide from Galarian Stunfisk, Bastiodon, Electric types like Galvantula, and bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn. One successful example of a Dewgong team is Dewgong/Medicham/Munchlax run by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAsianMilkMan" target="_blank">TheAsianMilkMan</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Yes, Dewgong does need both Ice Shard and Icy Wind to reach its full
  potential. Frost Breath + Icy Wind is surprisingly playable but faster Icy
  Winds are essential for Dewgong’s effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
  A word of caution: Dewgong could potentially have its removed moves
  returned in a future update, or Icy Wind could be nerfed following the fate
  of similar moves like Power-Up Punch and Ancient Power. This goes for the other Pokemon in this article, but only use Elite TM’s
  on Dewgong now if you want to win with it now.

  <a name="lapras"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Lapras</h3>
  <div class="article-section">
  <p>
  <strong>Moveset: </strong>
  <em>Ice Shard</em>
  + Surf & Skull Bash or <em>Ice Beam</em>
  <em>
	  <br/>
  </em>
  <strong>Formats: </strong>
  Great League, Ultra League, Premier Cup, Silph Arena
  </p>
  <p>
	  The second Water/Ice type in this article, this majestic Pokemon is a powerful contender in most formats where it's allowed thanks to its bulk and powerful moveset. <b>Lapras is a top pick in the Ultra League Premier Cup</b> in particular. You'll need the legacy move Ice Shard. After that, Surf is always one of its preferred Charged Moves, followed by Skull Bash in Great League and Premier Cup, which hits hard and raises Lapras's defenses even further. If you're playing in regular Ultra League, you may want to consider another Elite TM on Ice Beam for super effective hits against Giratina.
  </p>
  <p>In the Premier Cup, Lapras is one of the bulkiest Pokemon and synergizes well with starters like Charizard and Venusaur. It's forgiving to use and can dish out damage even in its bad matchups. If you don't have an Ice Shard Lapras in your collection, it's one of the best Elite TM candidates to date.</p>
  <p><b>Shadow Lapras has tradeoffs with regular Lapras</b>, but offers a harder hitting variant. In Great League, Shadow Lapras's Surf attacks are strong enough to take on Galarian Stunfisk, which regular Lapras can struggle with. It's a steep cost for Ultra League and doesn't provide many advantages over regular Lapras, but if you have the resources, more power to you!</p>

	<a name="zapdos"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Zapdos</h3>
  <div class="article-section">
<p>
    <strong>Moveset: </strong>
    <em>Thunder Shock</em>
    + Drill Peck &amp; Thunderbolt or Thunder
    <em>
        <br/>
    </em>
    <strong>Formats: </strong>
    Great League, Ultra League
</p>
<p>
    Thunder Shock Zapdos flew into raids a long while back, and although Zapdos
    became Great League eligible as a research breakthrough encounter, Great League Zapdos doesn't have access to Thunder Shock unless you use an Elite TM.
</p>
<p>
    Zapdos combines Charizard-like stats with one of the best defensive typings
    in the game—Electric and Flying—which is only weak to Ice and Rock. Thunder
    Shock and similar moves like Mud Shot and Psycho Cut are second only to
    Lock On in energy generation, giving Zapdos rapid access to Drill Peck and Thunderbolt.
</p>
<p>
    While it's strong and fast, <strong>Galarian Stunfisk poses a significant challenge to Zapdos's viability.</strong> If you can stomach that weakness or find a meta without Galarian Stunfisk, it has positive matchups against other meta players like Swampert, Skarmory, Tropius, and
    Toxicroak. It also stands up to future Great League giants like Jellicent
    and Mandibuzz.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most important matchups in the Great League is Azumarill, and here's where things get tricky for Zapdos. Below is a list of conditions for Zapdos to beat high-rank Azumarill in a direct 1-shield matchup:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/zapdos-16-11-2-5-4-4-0/azumarill-40-8-15-15-4-4-1/11/1-3-5/0-2-1/">Thunderbolt Zapdos</a> needs to hit a Thunder Shock breakpoint against Azumarill for its Thunderbolt to KO. This requires steep Attack IV's against high-rank Azumarill (11/2/5 guarantees the breakpoint against rank 1 Azumarill).</li>
		<li><a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/zapdos-15-15-14-12-4-4-0/azumarill-40-8-15-15-4-4-1/11/1-3-4/0-2-1/">Thunder Zapdos</a> needs 138.6 Attack (15 Attack IV for a research breakthrough Zapdos) for Thunder to KO a rank 1 Azumarill.</li>
		<li>Barring this, Thunder Zapdos should allow Azumarill to use its Charged Move first and attempt to <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/sandbox/1500/zapdos-15-10-14-12-4-4-0/azumarill-40-8-15-15-4-4-1/22/1-3-4/0-2-1/16.110100-19.101100-32.101000/">sneak in extra Thunder Shocks</a>. This extra difference is enough for Thunder to KO.</li>
		<li>All Zapdos lose head-on shields down and all Zapdos win investing two shields.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Should you run Thunderbolt or Thunder? For regular Zapdos, your decision could depend on the scenarios outlined above. Thunderbolt is 90 power/55 energy while Thunder is 100 power/60 energy. The first Charged Move takes 7 Thunder Shocks to reach but the second Thunderbolt only takes 6. This one may come down to personal preference but either work.</p>
<p>
    So you could get some Attack, but what if you wanted <em>more </em>Attack?
Enter Shadow Zapdos.    <strong>Shadow Zapdos locks down the Azumarill matchup </strong>and also
    picks up Sunny Cherrim, Jirachi, Scrafty, Umbreon, and Venusaur—and
    potentially Dewgong, Froslass, and Sableye with bait. This comes at the
    cost of Meganium and Swampert so there are tradeoffs. In general Shadow
    Zapdos is highly dangerous especially with energy; it has comparable Attack
    to Haunter with 20% more bulk. Thunderbolt is recommended for Shadow Zapdos so you can reach it slightly faster.
</p>
<p>
    In the Ultra League, Shadow Zapdos takes on meta staples such as Articuno,
    Poliwrath, Venusaur, Swampert, and Registeel. It’s rated as one of the
    safest switches that can force shields and take all but Giratina and
    Melmetal into the red.

	<h3 class="article-header">Charizard</h3>
	<div class="article-section">

    <strong>Moveset: </strong>
    <em>Wing Attack</em>

	<em>Dragon Breath</em>
	+ <em>Blast Burn</em> &amp; Dragon Claw<br>
    <strong>Formats: </strong>
    Great League, Ultra League, Premier Cup, Silph Arena
</p>
<p>Charizard has a slew of exclusive moves, including the October Community day move Dragon Breath. Blast Burn and Dragon Claw are almost always its preferred Charged Moves, but you might need an Elite TM to tie a bow on Charizard's moveset. Overheat is playable if you can't get Blast Burn but comes with a -2 Attack drop.</p>
<p>
    Before we get into specific movesets, let’s do a quick gut check on the numbers (including same-type attack bonus in damage):

<p>
    <b>Wing Attack Charizard has been a highly coveted legacy Pokemon</b>, especially in Silph Arena play.
    Wing Attack generates energy slightly faster but comes at the cost of
    damage. It can’t farm down opponents like Fire Spin can, which means Wing
    Attack Charizard usually has to spend energy to finish matchups.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        When to use Wing Attack or not depends on the meta and
        specific matchups
    </strong>
    you want to take advantage of. In Ultra League, for example, Charizard may prefer Fire Spin to handle Registeel and Articuno. In Great League, Charizard is up against a lot of Pokemon that resist
    Fire-type attacks, so Wing Attack Charizard puts
    up a better fight against the likes of Whiscash and Altaria. However, open
    Great League is still a hostile place for Charizard so look to make the
    most of Wing Attack Charizard in a future Silph Arena format or other themed cups.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Dragon Breath Charizard has incredible play in Ultra League,</b> including against other Charizard and <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/2500/charizard-35-0-13-15-4-4-1/giratina_altered/11/4-1-2-DRAGON_BREATH/1-2-3/" target="_blank">Giratina</a> itself. Charizard needs to be very high ranked IV's to make the most of it (low Attack IV, high HP & Defense IV), so save your Elite TM for an excellent candidate. Mega Charizard may also have play with Dragon Breath in Master League if Mega Evolutions are allowed in GO Battle League someday.

  <h3 class="article-header">Blaziken</h3>
  <div class="article-section">
<p>
  <strong>Moveset: </strong>
  Counter
  + Blaze Kick &amp; <em>Stone Edge</em>
  <em>
	  <br/>
  </em>
  <strong>Formats: </strong>
  Great League, Silph Arena
</p>
<p>
  Stone Edge Blaziken was one of the rarest legacy movesets. It was only available for a few days after release, and even if you had one, odds were slim it was under 1500 CP. Is this chicken a slam dunk or is it overrated?
</p>
<p>
  Blast Burn Blaziken has a lot of similarities to the old Alolan Raichu: a high-offense Pokemon that ran a bait and a nuke move of the same type, powerful in the right Silph Arena meta in the right situation but vulnerable to being hard countered. <b>Stone Edge solves Blaziken's big coverage problem and makes it much more forgiving to use.</b> Blast Burn + Blaze Kick Blaziken is completely stuck against the likes of Altaria and Mantine, but with Stone Edge it can draw shields and potentially flip matchups it couldn't before.
</p>
<p>Why Blaze Kick instead of Blast Burn and Stone Edge? Blast Burn and Stone Edge give Blaziken a powerful pair of closing moves. However, this set lacks flexibility which is a big selling point for unlocking Stone Edge in the first place. Blaze Kick allows Blaziken to still perform its Fire-type role and also provides a bait move for Stone Edge.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Stone Edge Blaziken has a lower ceiling without Blast Burn but a higher floor. If you find maneuvering with Blaziken a challenge, Stone Edge can make it more comfortable and forgiving to run. Want to try it out before spending your precious Elite TM? Head over to <a href="/train/">Training Battles</a> and test it out against a bot opponent!</p>

	<a name="mewtwo"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Mewtwo</h3>
<div class="article-section">
<p>
    <strong>Moveset: </strong>
    Psycho Cut + <em>Psystrike </em>&amp; Focus Blast or
    <em>
        Shadow Ball
        <br/>
    </em>
    <strong>Formats: </strong>
    Master League
</p>
<p>
    Mewtwo has been in raids with Psytrike and Shadow Ball as exclusive moves,
    but now they can be wielded together for the first time. Psystrike
    provides incredible neutral damage and Shadow Ball allows it to bully
    Giratina more. While Shadow Ball is better than Ice Beam or Flamethrower against meta titan Dialga, regular Mewtwo is generally preferred with Focus Blast for the OHKO potential.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to go all in,
    <strong>
        Shadow Mewtwo with Psystrike/Shadow Ball becomes an incredible safe switch
    </strong>
    that will force shields against anything. Shadow Mewtwo needs shields to operate and may fall short of regular Mewtwo in reaching multiple Charged Moves, but its power needs to be respected and can easily put your opponent on the back foot.
</p>

	<a name="mew"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Mew</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
<p>
	<strong>Moveset:</strong> Shadow Claw + Wild Charge & Surf or Flame Charge<br>
    <strong>Formats: </strong>
    Great League
</p>
<p>
    Mew is a unique Pokemon on this list because it doesn’t have a legacy move
    to obtain. Instead, Elite TM’s allow you to navigate its dozens of moves to
    finally get the “mewvset” you’ve wanted.
</p>
<p>
    Now the question is, which set do you want? Shadow Claw is typically Mew's best Fast Move, with great energy generation and solid neutral damage against most targets. Wild Charge can also be considered standard for Mew with its immense power targeting Azumarill and Skarmory. Surf is a typical second Charged Move to hit Galarian Stunfisk, but Flame Charge is another option with more technical play.
</p>
<p>
    These are the standard "mewvsets" but the great thing about Mew is it can plug any hole in your team. There are a lot strong moves in its movepool, including Rock Slide, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot. If you want to go big with a move like Focus Blast, consider pairing it with a spammier move like Psyshock or Dragon Claw.
</p>
<p><b>Mew makes a great safe switch</b> where opponents are pressured to guess which moves you have and shield often. Azumarill is a great partner to cover it from Dark types like Umbreon. While this section covers Mew for Great League, if you've already powered yours up it could have Ultra League play as well. Look for moves like Ice Beam, Grass Knot, Flame Charge, or Dark Pulse to target key meta Pokemon like Giratina, Swampert, Melmetal, or Cresselia.</p>

    Longtime PvP players probably have all the essential Community Day moves in
    their collection. If you’re just entering the arena, you can use Elite TM’s
    to catch up. These moves may be available later via future Community Day
    events, special Raid events, or local trade partners, so only use Elite
    TM’s for these if you need them right now. The Community Day and Raid Day
    Pokemon below are top tier in the listed formats, so obtaining them could
    be well worth it:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Hydro Cannon Swampert: </strong>
        Great, Ultra, Master, Silph Arena<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Frenzy Plant Venusaur: </strong>
        Great, Ultra, Silph Arena<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Frenzy Plant Meganium: </strong>
        Great, Ultra, Silph Arena<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Meteor Mash Metagross: </strong>
        Master<strong></strong>
    </li>
	<li>
        <strong>Blast Burn Charizard: </strong>
        Ultra, Silph Arena<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Last Resort Umbreon: </strong>
        Great, Silph Arena<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hurricane Articuno: </strong>
        Ultra<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Psystrike Armored Mewtwo: </strong>
        Ultra<strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you already have these in your collection, you’re good to go. There’s
another question worth asking:    <strong>what about Shadow Pokemon with their Community Day moves?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The answer like most things involving Shadow Pokemon is it depends. Each
    Shadow Pokemon has its advantages and drawbacks. As a quick note, Elite
    TM’s can't remove Frustration from Shadow Pokemon. If you’re
    a fan of the Silph Arena, high-performing Shadow Pokemon are likely ban
    suspects, so gear your Elite TM and Shadow Pokemon decisions toward GO
    Battle League and freestyle.
</p>
<p>
    Below are relevant Shadow Pokemon with their Community Day moves and notes
    about how they compare to their regular counterparts:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Blast Burn Shadow Charizard: </strong>
        Extra attack potentially snatches matchups like Umbreon, Hypno,
        Melmetal, and Sableye. More bait dependent but with even more
        terrifying bait potential. Generally better with Fire Spin than Wing Attack; Shadow Charizard wants to
        avoid extended, Charged Move-based fights.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hydro Cannon Shadow Swampert: </strong>
        In Great League and Master League, generally worse than regular
        Swampert. Less bulk stops Shadow Swampert short of Hydro Cannons
        regular Swampert can reach. Shadow Swampert fares better in Ultra
        League with more relative bulk to work with.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Frenzy Plant Shadow Venusaur: </strong>
        Direct matchups are roughly the same as regular Venusaur, dropping
        Umbreon and Shiftry. More potent Frenzy Plant will KO Azumarill before
it reaches Ice Beam but lower capacity to take that Ice Beam.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shadow Meteor Mash Metagross: </strong>
        Shadow Metagross loses the ability to consistently combat Melmetal and
Dialga. Top neutral damage generalist for the raiders in the room.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Earth Power Shadow Flygon: </strong>
        Similar to Charizard, Shadow boost gives Earth Power the extra strength
        it always needed and makes Dragon Claw spam even more deadly. Potential
        in Great and Ultra Leagues but vulnerable to top meta picks like
        Azumarill and Articuno.<strong></strong>
    </li>
	<li>
        <strong>Synchronoise Shadow Gardevoir: </strong>
        One Shadow Pokemon that’s pretty much a universal upgrade. Synchronoise
        unlocks Shadow Gardevoir’s fastest available move which is
        valuable alongside Charm’s low energy gain.<strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>

    There are a lot of Pokemon worth considering with their legacy movesets. Here are a few more that could be worth an Elite TM:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Earthquake Politoed: </strong>
        Honorary mudboi with a lot of potential, capable of challenging Azumarill and Galarian STunfisk. Pure Water type so it
        fully resists Water and Ice-type attacks and isn’t double weak to
        Grass. Also handles meta favorites like Alolan Marowak, and
        even beats its compatriots Swampert and Whiscash head to head. Shadow
        Politoed performs generally worse in head to head matchups but better
        with energy.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Razor Leaf Weepinbell: </strong>
        Highest Attack stat of any Razor Leaf user in the game. Doesn’t offer
        many practical advantages over Victreebel, who has a much better move
pool, but could be fun to play with, especially the Shadow variant.<strong></strong>
    </li>
	<li>
        <strong>Poison Jab/Icy Wind/Drill Run Seaking: </strong>
        Former anti-meta unicorn is less worthy of an Elite TM these days with Galarian Stunfisk overtaking Registeel. May have themed cup potential down the road but don't invest until you're sure you want to use it.<strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
