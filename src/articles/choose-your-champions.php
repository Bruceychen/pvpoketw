	<h1>Choose Your Champions</h1>
	<div class="date">Last updated June 7th, 2019</div>
	<p>Season 1 Championships are ahead, and the very  best trainers will be going head to head! If you are one of them, or even just  spectating, you know the team building challenge that lies in store - in the  Championships, competitors can only have two of the following Pokemon on their  teams of 6: <strong>Azumarill, Medicham, Lucario, Altaria, Skarmory, Venusaur,  Tropius, Meganium, Bastiodon, </strong>and <strong>Probopass</strong>. </p>
	<p><img src="<?php echo $WEB_ROOT; ?>assets/articles/championships-infographic.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Which should you pick, and what are viable  alternatives? This article covers the strengths and weaknesses of the  Pokemon above, and how to search far and wide for potential replacements. The list below is by no means comprehensive or represents all or even most of the Pokemon who may appear in the Championships, but hopefully helps you find solid  options. The process I went through for writing this article was to take each Pokemon, boil them down to their essential functions (no Pokemon were harmed in the writing!), and see which other Pokemon compare. Who qualifies for the position of Azumarill or Bastiodon? Time to turn our Pokemon hats backwards and get down to business!  </p>

Also, shout out to squawk from the <a href="https://discord.gg/fbczGXZ" target="_blank">GO: Stadium Discord</a> for feedback on the picks in this article. Some of them are quite peculiar, so let's dive in.</p>

  <a name="azumarill"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Azumarill</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>Azumarill has been a centralizing figure in just  about every cup it&rsquo;s been allowed. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at why Azumarill is  the top bunny, and how to replace what it brings to the table. When looking at  Azumarill or Azumarill replacements, we want it to be able to do these things: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Stop Medicham and other Fighting types in their tracks</li>
        <li>Protect your team against Sableye or Umbreon</li>
        <li>Apply super effective pressure to tanks or fliers</li>
        <li>Win neutral matchups through sheer bulk      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is an awful lot to ask from a single  Pokemon! We&rsquo;ll look at replacements that can accomplish most of these. Ultimately, if you're foregoing Azumarill, aim to spread Azumarill's capabilities across multiple Pokemon on your team rather than  straight up replace it.</p>
	<h3>Azumarill</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type water">Water</span><span class="type fairy">Fairy</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Bubble + Play  Rough/Hydro Pump or Ice Beam <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Medicham,  Lucario, Altaria, Skarmory, Bastiodon, Sableye <br>
      <strong>Counters: </strong>Venusaur,  Meganium, Tropius, Ivysaur, Lanturn, Magneton, Haunter </p>
      <p>Azumarill&rsquo;s fantastic typing, bulk, and  incredible coverage give it a ton of key winning matchups. Play Rough is  essential for the mirror as well as beating down Medicham and Sableye; Ice Beam  gives you an out against Grass types, a super effective option against most  alternative Flying types, and a (however slight) shield bait option. Hydro  Pump, meanwhile, is lethal knockout move that threatens Bastiodon and Skarmory,  who can go toe to toe with the Ice Beam variant. </p>
      <p>Looking at Azumarill&rsquo;s key matchups, it&rsquo;s no  wonder why it feels like a must pick. It beats 5 of the other 9 limited Pokemon  head to head and has coverage options against the remaining 4. As you&rsquo;ll see  below, there are other Pokemon that can fill in similar gaps but not to the  same extent as Azumarill. This is for sure the Pokemon to beat at  Championships, but what if you want to brave the waters without it? </p>
		<h3>Blastoise</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type water">Water</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Water Gun + Hydro  Cannon/Ice Beam <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Sableye, Haunter <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Venusaur,  Meganium, Tropius, Ivysaur, Lanturn, Magneton </p>
      <p>Who&rsquo;s got sunglasses and one of the most  powerful moves in the game? Blastoise is out here throwing shade at with decent bulk and coverage that means little gets by it without a bruise. For one, it has the Bastiodon matchup locked down. It can  even challenge Medicham and Skarmory in very close matchups. </p>
      <p>Blastoise has similarities to Whiscash, for example, but a few  key differences set it apart. No Ground type means it doesn&rsquo;t take as much punishment from Grass Fast Moves, but its moveset is also slower and overall  less flexible. It also loses the valuable Lanturn matchup. But Blastoise never,  ever loses its cool. </p>
		<h3>Hypno</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type psychic">Psychic</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Confusion + Focus  Blast/Shadow Ball or Psyshock <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Medicham,  Azumarill, Venusaur, Lanturn <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Sableye,  Umbreon </p>
      <p>I must be hypnotized, because Hypno isn&rsquo;t a  Water type! That&rsquo;s okay, because Hypno wraps up a lot of Azumarill&rsquo;s  capabilities in a very different package. High bulk? Check. Resisting Fighting  and hitting hard back? Check. Super effective threat for Bastiodon and  Probopass? Double check! And Confusion will hurt frontrunner Grass types like  Venusaur, Ivysaur, and Victreebel. </p>
      <p>Hypno takes up Azumarill&rsquo;s anti-Fighting nature with hard-hitting Confusion damage and powerful Charged Moves to back  it up. Legacy moves are a requirement here; either Shadow Ball or Psyshock will  work. Shadow Ball is likely the preferred option, capable of beating out  Azumarill, but Psyshock baits shields better (which Hypno may need to  do to net wins against Bastiodon). </p>
      <p>Hypno has one big disadvantage compared to  Azumarill, and that&rsquo;s its matchups against Dark types. Umbreon and Sableye can  completely wall it. If strength against Fighting types is what you&rsquo;re looking  for, Hypno is your guy, but consider another alternative if you want to avoid a  Dark-type trap. </p>
    </div>

	<a name="medicham"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Medicham</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>Medicham has been contending since there were  contenders, and ever since Power-Up Punch, it&rsquo;s been an anchor in the Great  League. Fighting&rsquo;s main job is to beat up Steel types, but Pokemon like  Medicham with great stats and coverage evolve beyond their role to turn whole  cups into their personal punching bags. </p>
      <p>Medicham has several alternatives if you want  some punch on your squad. The main thing we want Medicham or a Medicham  replacement to do are: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Beat down Steel types that try to wall the rest of the       team</li>
        <li>Win against other Fighting types</li>
        <li>Pack good coverage to hit Fighting counters and other       valuable targets</li>
        <li>Gain momentum to overpower the opponent</li>
      </ul>
		<h3>Medicham</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type fighting">Fighting</span><span class="type psychic">Psychic</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Counter + Power-Up  Punch/Dynamic Punch <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Lucario,  Bastiodon, Probopass, Whiscash, Lanturn <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Azumarill,  Sableye, Alolan Marowak, Haunter </p>
      <p>The one and only. Counter damage that  ramps up over time, excellent coverage in Ice Punch, hips for days - Medicham  is a Pokemon that can snowball into a wrecking ball. An advantage that Medicham  has over its competitors is that in can shield twice and win almost any  matchup. Only a select few things can challenge Medicham at full strength, and  those mainly include the Ghost types like Sableye, Haunter, and Alolan Marowak.  Fliers like Skarmory can get the job done, but if Medicham has built up boosts or energy, it&rsquo;s not always a sure victory. </p>
      <p>Medicham&rsquo;s typing is also peculiar, and it&rsquo;s both  a blessing and a curse. The Psychic typing lets it resist other Fighting  attacks and take neutral damage to Confusion, but allows Ghost to hit for super  effective damage and Dark to hit for neutral damage. Medicham is also the  bulkiest Fighting type, so you really need to press every advantage if you want  to beat it. </p>
      <p>If you bring Medicham, beware of opponents who  have constructed their lineup to scare Medicham away with Pokemon like  Azumarill, Skarmory, Venusaur, or Sableye. They may be using scare tactics so  they can run Bastiodon or Probopass unopposed. Evaluate your opponent and do  your best to judge if they will really bring their Medicham counters. It will  help to have a backup plan for Bastiodon or Probopass, such as Whiscash! </p>
		<h3>Hitmonchan</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type fighting">Fighting</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Counter + Power-Up  Punch/Ice Punch <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Lucario,  Blastoise, Quagsire, Bastiodon, Probopass <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Azumarill, Sableye, Alolan Marowak, Haunter, Confusion users </p>
      <p>Say hello to Medicham&rsquo;s stunt double, right down  to the moveset. Hitmonchan may not have the bulk, but that actually gives it an  edge. </p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re a Venusaur, Tropius, or Altaria, you  know not to fall for Medicham&rsquo;s shield baits. Medicham&rsquo;s Attack is low enough  that these Pokemon can take an unshielded Ice Punch and still come out on top.  Not so against Hitmonchan! Hitmonchan has higher Attack, which means these  Pokemon will be tempting fate if they don&rsquo;t shield. </p>
      <p>All three elemental punches are viable for  Hitmonchan, but Ice Punch will likely give it the best coverage. Fire Punch can  specifically target Skarmory (although Hitmonchan can bludgeon Skarmory  through Power-Up Punch if it has to), while Thunder Punch may have uses against  Azumarill and alternative Water types like Mantine or Blastoise. </p>
		<h3>Toxicroak</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type poison">Poison</span><span class="type fighting">Fighting</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Poison Jab + Mud  Bomb/Sludge Bomb <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lucario, Bastiodon, Probopass, Tropius (1 shield), Lanturn <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Whiscash, Quagsire, Confusion users, switch glitch vs. Confusion users </p>
      <p>This veteran from Twilight and Nightmare has a  lot of anti-meta tools that make it dangerous. Poison typing lets it resist  Fighting attacks, and Toxicroak comes with both spammable and powerful Charged  Moves. This lets it take on other Fighting Pokemon head to head like Medicham  can while doing its tank-busting tasks. </p>
      <p>Poison Jab chunks down Azumarill and hits most  Pokemon for neutral damage. Mud Bomb is fantastic because not only does it beat  the tanks, but it also gives valuable coverage against other Poison Pokemon  like Haunter, and Electric Pokemon like Lanturn or Alolan Raichu. Meanwhile,  Sludge Bomb puts the hurt on Azumarill and Tropius. Counter is also an option if you are relying on your Fighting Pokemon to take down Umbreon, as Toxicroak can't beat Umbreon without it. </p>
      <p>A key difference between Toxicroak and Medicham  is it has none of the bulk. It&rsquo;s in the league of squishy where you may want to  shield almost any attack, even neutral ones. Keep an itchy trigger finger, too,  especially if you see a Confusion user on the opponent&rsquo;s team. You want to  avoid having Toxicroak locked against them at all costs! </p>
    </div>

	<a name="lucario"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Lucario</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>Lucario may be a fan favorite, but hasn&rsquo;t had  the spotlight in more open tournament formats for a few reasons. First, it  loses to all other Fighting options. This puts it in a rough spot when the  Fighting mirror is a rather frequent occurrence. Second, Lucario needs shields  against everything, even the things it counters. It doesn&rsquo;t appreciate a  Flamethrower to the face! </p>
      <p>So what makes Lucario special? If you&rsquo;re looking  at a Pokemon like Lucario, you want to be able to: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Beat Steel types like any Fighter should</li>
        <li>Flip the script on Flying type Pokemon</li>
        <li>Have a crippling coverage option</li>
      </ul>
		<h3>Lucario</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type fighting">Fighting</span><span class="type steel">Steel</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Counter + Power-Up  Punch/Shadow Ball <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Bastiodon, Probopass, Meganium, Lanturn <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Whiscash, Quagsire, Haunter </p>
      <p>Two things about Lucario. Steel typing makes  Flying attacks neutral against it, so it can beat up would-be Fighting checks  like Skarmory and Noctowl. Second, Shadow Ball is a powerful move  that threatens everything with major damage, especially Ghost hard counters  like Haunter. Lucario&rsquo;s shield baiting potential is much more potent than  Medicham&rsquo;s because there are few things that can afford to let a Shadow Ball go  unblocked. </p>
      <p>The question is, does Lucario deserve one of  those two treasured spots? The answer is likely no. However, it could find  success against lineups that depend on a Flying Pokemon to remove Fighting  threats.</p>
		<h3>Vigoroth</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type normal">Normal</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Counter + Body  Slam/Bulldoze <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Lanturn, Noctowl, Mantine, <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Venusaur, Tropius, Meganium </p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t slack off this coming Community Day!  Vigoroth is a potent Pokemon who has had trouble standing out since Medicham  became the center of attention, but it could fill a niche in the Championships.  Normal typing means it doesn&rsquo;t take super effective from Flying attacks, and is  more than capable of taking it to Pokemon like Noctowl and Mantine. It is also immune to Ghost attacks, which could be critical against teams that rely on a Haunter or Sableye to counter Fighting.</p>
      <p>Body Slam allows for incredible neutral damage  spam against most targets, while Counter and Bulldoze can take down things that  resist Normal attacks. Bulldoze is nowhere near as good as Mud Bomb, but the  Ground type coverage is just as valuable. </p>
      <p>Like Lucario, Vigoroth will struggle against  genuine Fighting types. Grass types like Venusaur and Tropius are also a  problem because they resist Fighting and Ground attacks. </p>
		<h3>Sudowoodo</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type rock">Rock</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Counter + Rock  Slide/Earthquake <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Bastiodon, Probopass, Umbreon <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Azumarill, Tropius </p>
      <p>Sudowoodo is neither a real tree nor a real  Fighting type! It goes to the next level by fully resisting Flying type  attacks. This puts it in the unique position of a Fighting attacker that can  convincingly beat Skarmory. STAB Rock Slide is very dangerous and what you want  to spam most of the time. Earthquake targets Bastiodon and Probopass. Watch out  for Steel-type attacks like Flash Cannon and Magnet Bomb! </p>
      <p>Similarly to Lucario, Sudowoodo goes down  against Fighting types. Its Rock typing also makes it especially vulnerable to  Razor Leaf and Water attacks. </p>
    </div>

	<a name="skarmory"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Skarmory</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>It&rsquo;s a bird! It&rsquo;s a plane! It&rsquo;s a flying  fortress that has terrorized almost every cup it&rsquo;s been allowed! Skarmory is an  incredibly valuable Pokemon whose bag of tricks include the ability to: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Farm Grass types to unleash dangerous attacks on the       next opponent</li>
        <li>Threaten Fighting types</li>
        <li>Resist and beat other Flying types</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This skillset is hard to find in any other  Pokemon, but we&rsquo;ll take a look at Skarmory itself and &nbsp;a few Pokemon that  come close. </p>
		<h3>Skarmory</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type steel">Steel</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Air Slash + Sky  Attack/Flash Cannon <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Tropius,  Venusaur, Meganium, Whiscash, Quagsire, Altaria <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Lanturn, Magneton </p>
      <p>Skarmory has been the bread and butter of  multiple metas for its powerful attacks and valuable resistances. While  Skarmory can take on Fighting type Pokemon if it has to, the real reason it&rsquo;s  here is to bodyguard your Ground/Water Pokemon and turn Grass type Pokemon into  energy batteries wherever it gets the chance. It has far overtaken its main  competition, Altaria, for beating Altaria itself and being neutral to prominent  Ice coverage. Flash Cannon is also nice for denting Bastiodon and Probopass who  may be unlikely to block it.</p>
		<h3>Noctowl</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type normal">Normal</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Wing Attack + Sky  Attack/Psychic <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Tropius,  Venusaur, Meganium, Medicham, Sableye, Haunter, Alolan Marowak <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Lanturn </p>
      <p>Noctowl makes its debut as a very convincing  option for the Flying slot. Its Normal typing doesn&rsquo;t hurt it as much as you&rsquo;d  expect because that&rsquo;s offset by high bulk. Noctowl beats Grass and Medicham,  and its immunity to Ghost attacks makes it a uniquely able to take down all the  Ghost flex picks. It can even tank a Sludge Bomb from Haunter. </p>
      <p>One downside is Noctowl can&rsquo;t farm energy easily  with Wing Attack - it typically has to take down its targets with Sky Attack,  leaving it with less energy for the next matchup. Do your best to squeeze as  much energy as you can out of your Grass opponents before a Sludge Bomb or Acid  Spray comes your way. </p>
		<h3>Charizard</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type fire">Fire</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Fire Spin + Dragon  Claw/Blast Burn <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Tropius,  Venusaur, Meganium <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Lanturn, Azumarill, Blastoise </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Spin to win&rdquo; is Charizard&rsquo;s motto. It can use  Grass types to farm energy for multiple, lethal Blast Burns that will send just  about any Pokemon packing. It also has Dragon Claw as a spam and shield bait  option. On top of that, it can threaten Skarmory and Medicham if it has energy built  up or if it can bait shields with Dragon Claw. </p>
    <p>Charizard is a risky Pokemon that requires  shields in almost all scenarios and can&rsquo;t tough it out in neutral matchups like  Skarmory can. Bastiodon and Probopass also beat it in the blink of an eye. Building up energy leads is critical for Charizard, and it can wipe multiple Pokemon or force multiple shields when it does its job correctly.    </p></div>

	<a name="altaria"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Altaria</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>Altaria reminisces about the glory days where it  was king of the skies. Azumarill, Skarmory, Bastiodon and prominent Ice  coverage have all come along to take it down a peg. If you&rsquo;re eyeing Altaria  and an Altaria-lookalike for your roster, here&rsquo;s what you want to accomplish: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Wall Grass types</li>
        <li>Threaten Fighting types</li>
        <li>Challenge Electric counters</li>
        <li>Win neutral matchups through oppressive Fast Move damage</li>
      </ul>
		<h3>Altaria</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type dragon">Dragon</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Dragon Breath + Sky  Attack/Dragon Pulse <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Tropius,  Venusaur, Meganium, Lanturn, Haunter <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Azumarill </p>
      <p>Altaria&rsquo;s secret ingredient is Dragon Breath,  one of the strongest Fast Moves in the game that gives it the ability to power  through a ton of matchups. Unfortunately Dragon Breath is resisted by a number  of key Pokemon like Azumarill and Bastiodon, but Altaria can still apply  pressure in lots of other matchups. It&rsquo;s also one of the bulkiest Flying types,  so it can take an Ice Punch and still put up a fight. </p>
      <p>Look to burn down Grass types, and since you  take neutral damage to Electric attacks, you can take on Flying counters like  Lanturn and Alolan Raichu. This is Altaria&rsquo;s biggest plus compared to Skarmory,  but it should carefully considered with its drawbacks: double Ice weakness, losing to Skarmory, and getting hard countered by Azumarill.</p>
		<h3>Dragonite</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type dragon">Dragon</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Dragon Breath + Dragon  Claw/Outrage <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Tropius,  Venusaur, Meganium, Lanturn, Blastoise, Haunter <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Steelix, Azumarill </p>
      <p>Not to be underestimated in Great League, Legacy  Dragonite trades bulk for a speedy attack in Dragon Claw and raw offensive  power. Dragonite is to Altaria and Charizard is to Skarmory, packing heat but  needing shields to stay in the fight. Only dedicated counters will escape  Dragon Breath unscathed. Like Altaria, it can beat Electric types that have  sure matchups against other Flying Pokemon. </p>
      <p>Dragonite has to be constantly alert for Ice  coverage from Medicham, Hitmonchan, and others. Where Altaria can afford to let  some attacks go unblocked, Dragonite has to consider shielding most attacks  that come its way. </p>
		<h3>Beedrill</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type bug">Bug</span><span class="type poison">Poison</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Poison Jab + Sludge  Bomb/X-Scissor or Aerial Ace <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Medicham, Tropius, Venusaur, Meganium <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Bastiodon,  Probopass, Skarmory, Sableye, Whiscash, Quagsire </p>
      <p>Beedrill is applying for a job that requires 3  years of Dragon Breath experience, but it still meets the important  qualifications and is eager to learn on the job. So what&rsquo;s all the buzz about? Beedrill  has a ton of anti-meta capabilities. It swats away Razor Leafers and other  Grass types, takes down Fighting Pokemon, and beats Azumarill while it&rsquo;s at it.  Beedrill can&rsquo;t defeat Electric Pokemon like Altaria can, but it still plays  those matchups pretty close. </p>
      <p>Poison Jab and Sludge Bomb are your anti-meta  weapons. X-Scissor may be preferred for its speed and shield baiting  capabilities, but you can go with Aerial Ace for a stronger sting against Grass  and Fighting types. However, you do lose manueverability and strength against Electrics.</p>
      <p>For all its pros, Beedrill has its cons, too.  Its bad matchups are very bad, and they happen to be against really prominent  opponents like Skarmory, Whiscash, and Bastiodon. Be careful with the bee and  make sure it doesn&rsquo;t get locked into a nightmare situation. </p>
	</div>

	<a name="bastiodon"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Bastiodon &amp; Probopass</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>This dinosaur isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, and neither is its moustachioed compadre. Before Bastiodon and Probopass came along, there weren&rsquo;t many Pokemon that could take on the entire Flying  roster, and do it so resoundingly. Two double weaknesses don&rsquo;t even slow them down. A Bastiodon or Probopass should: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Knock Flying types out of the sky</li>
        <li>Apply pressure in bad matchups</li>
        <li>Conquer neutral matchups through sheer bulk and       resistances</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bastiodon is one of the best at what it does and not many Pokemon have moustaches,  but we&rsquo;ll dig up a few alternatives that can fill in. </p>
		<h3>Bastiodon</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type rock">Rock</span><span class="type steel">Steel</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Smack Down + Stone  Edge/Flamethrower <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Tropius, Haunter <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Lucario, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Meganium </p>
      <p>Bastiodon has Chansey and Blissey levels of raw  bulk plus excellent typing to boot. It beats almost every Flying Pokemon it can  encounter (Gligar and Gliscor wave in the meta-irrelevant distance). Where other anti-Flying Pokemon may  need to use Charged Attacks to do the job, Bastiodon is more capable of farming  and can hurt the next Pokemon with its decent coverage. </p>
      <p>Both Stone Edge and Flamethrower cost the same  energy, so this can make Bastiodon one-dimensional. It isn&rsquo;t going to pull off  any trick plays, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to. Bulk wins the day. It&rsquo;s this bulk that  makes Bastiodon a valuable anti-anti-meta weapon as well. Whichever wild picks  your opponent throws your way, Bastiodon is a safety net against the  unexpected. This key advantage over its alternatives is yet another reason to  consider it for one of your restricted Pokemon. </p>

		<h3>Probopass</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type rock">Rock</span><span class="type steel">Steel</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Spark + Rock  Slide/Thunderbolt <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Bastiodon <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Lucario, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Meganium </p>
      <p>Probopass uses Electric instead of Rock attacks  that allow it to beat Flying Pokemon but also take on Bastiodon as well. It  doesn&rsquo;t have quite as much bulk, but a faster moveset gives it more punch. You  can choose to go for Thunderbolt for the knockout, or build up some energy and  spam Rock Slide. </p>
      <p>Hydro Pump is still a threat but Probopass can  challenge it much better with its Electric moves. This key difference helps  separate it from Bastiodon. Probopass struggles against similar opponents, such  as Ground and Fighting types, and Grass types who resist the Electric attacks. </p>

		<h3>Steelix</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type steel">Steel</span><span class="type ground">Ground</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Dragon Tail +  Crunch/Earthquake <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Lanturn, Bastiodon, Probopass, Alolan Marowak <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Azumarill,  Medicham, Lucario, Whiscash, Quagsire, Blastoise, Tropius, Meganium </p>
      <p>Steelix has shared the battlefield with  Bastiodon before. Here, it faces more threats in Grass and Water types. As a  Bastiodon alternative, it beats Flying types (look out for Bubble Mantine),  beats both Bastiodon and Probopass, and has an easier time against Lanturn.  Crunch is also valuable as a Ghost-chomper. </p>
      <p>Where Bastiodon plays it straight, Steelix loves  being sneaky between Crunch and Earthquake. Baiting shields is a valuable part  of Steelix&rsquo;s play and can be used to great effect. Note that you can beat  Bastiodon and Probopass with straight Earthquakes (either of those locked  against you are likely not to shield anyway). </p>

		<h3>Lanturn</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type water">Water</span><span class="type electric">Electric</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Water Gun +  Thunderbolt/Hydro Pump <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Noctowl, Azumarill <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Venusaur,  Meganium, Tropius, Whiscash </p>
      <p>Lanturn has been an anti-Flying staple for a  long time, and here it can fulfill the same role as Probopass and in some ways  improve upon it. Lanturn has a slightly more convincing Azumarill matchup and  while it's still beaten by most Fighting options, it isn&rsquo;t completely toothless. </p>
      <p>Where Probopass hits Bastiodon with neutral  damage from Spark, Lanturn can go super effective with Water Gun. Water Gun  also lays the hurt on Steelix. Lanturn, however, is particularly vulnerable to  Grass types, making it prohibitive to run on the same team as Azumarill. It&rsquo;s  also much slower than you'd like it to be.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Lanturn has excellent matchups  against several core Pokemon, so anticipate seeing it on many rosters. </p>

		<h3>Magneton</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type electric">Electric</span><span class="type steel">Steel</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Thunder Shock +  Discharge/Magnet Bomb <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Blastoise <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Medicham,  Lucario, Whiscash, Quagsire, Alolan Marowak, Meganium, Venusaur </p>
      <p>Legacy Magneton has paper-thin defensive stats,  but double-resisting Flying definitely helps. It takes out Flying Pokemon like Skarmory at ridiculous speed. Unfortunately for Magneton, it can&rsquo;t double  resist everything, and it&rsquo;ll find itself quickly overpowered in neutral  matchups. One positive is it can take on Water types like Blastoise where  Bastiodon and Steelix would struggle. </p>

		<h3>Alolan Raichu</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type electric">Electric</span><span class="type psychic">Psychic</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Spark + Thunder  Punch/Wild Charge <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Skarmory,  Noctowl, Azumarill, Medicham (0 &amp; 1 shield) <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Venusaur,  Meganium, Tropius, Whiscash, Quagsire </p>
      <p>This little rodent proved in Nightmare Cup that  it packs a punch, and it flew under the radar in Regionals as an anti-Flying  Pokemon with an anti-meta pinch. Alolan Raichu can not only take on Skarmory  and Azumarill with its Electric attacks, but it resists Fighting as well and  can take on Medicham. Shield baiting is an essential part of Alolan Raichu&rsquo;s  toolkit. It&rsquo;s a Pokemon you&rsquo;ll want practice with to learn which matchups you  need to bait shields and which you can straight Thunder Punch or Wild Charge. Unlike  its competition, Raichu is on the fragile side and needs shield support. </p>

	<a name="venusaur"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Venusaur &amp; Tropius</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>Grass Pokemon have one job: beat Azumarill and  other bulky Water Pokemon. Venusaur and Tropius overachieve by providing  incredible utility while beating other Grass types. Thankfully, there are a few  Pokemon who can replicate their success. Here are the qualifications for being  a Venusaur or Tropius, or a Venusaur/Tropius replacement: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Dominate Water types</li>
        <li>Beat other Grass types</li>
        <li>Resist and challenge Fighting types</li>
        <li>High damage or other utility in neutral matchups</li>
      </ul>
		<h3>Venusaur</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span><span class="type poison">Poison</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Vine Whip + Frenzy  Plant/Sludge Bomb <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Meganium, Tropius <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Alolan Marowak </p>
      <p>Vine Whip versus Razor Leaf has been a  longstanding debate. For Venusaur in particular, I recommend Vine Whip for  faster energy gain and vastly better utility compared to Razor Leaf. Frenzy  Plant is one of the most powerful moves in the game, so Razor Leaf feels like  Venusaur is carrying Excalibur with its shoelaces tied together. You are more maneuverable  and dangerous with Vine Whip; where Venusaur might be lucky to get one Sludge  Bomb using Razor Leaf, Vine Whip gives it several and allows for trick plays. </p>
      <p>Venusaur shines when it can burn through shields or lay waste to opponents that can&rsquo;t block Frenzy Plant. The Poison  typing is also valuable for resisting Fighting moves. One downside to Venusaur  is that it&rsquo;s less bulky than other Grass options, so it needs to be conscious  of opposing Charged Moves that can cripple it. You also need to be careful  of Confusion users on the other team, who can farm a locked Venusaur for  energy. </p>
		<h3>Tropius</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span><span class="type flying">Flying</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Razor Leaf or Air Slash  + Leaf Blade/Aerial Ace <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Sableye, Umbreon <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Venusaur, Bastiodon </p>
      <p>Tropius combines some of the best traits of  Venusaur and Meganium. It resists Fighting without being weak to Confusion, it  beats other Grass types, and it has the bulk to slug it out against the likes  of Hypno and Umbreon. </p>
      <p>It also has its drawbacks. Where other Grass  types can challenge or beat Bastiodon, Tropius gets countered. Tropius also  loses to the Vine Whip variant of Venusaur and Ivysaur. Last but certainly not  least, Tropius comes with a double Ice weakness. It has so much bulk this isn&rsquo;t  a death sentence against weaker coverage moves like Ice Punch, but you need to  watch out for Ice Beam Azumarill and Blizzard from Whiscash. </p>
      <p>On an entirely separate topic, Tropius can run  Air Slash to convert into a genuine Flying type. Air Slash generates energy  much quicker than Razor Leaf, allowing Tropius to take advantage of its Charged  Moves more effectively. It also has a surprise factor, and those crucial  moments it takes for your opponent to realize your moveset could be a  difference maker. Note that your lineup can potentially give away your  Tropius&rsquo;s moveset, depending on whether it is your only Grass or Flying type. </p>
      <p>Air Slash Tropius can farm other Grass types for  energy like Skarmory can (be careful of Sludge Bomb, though). It also generally  wins against the same Water Pokemon, and becomes more deadly to Fighting  Pokemon. However this comes with some drawbacks, too. As a flier, it loses to  all other fliers. It can also no longer beat Ice Beam Azumarill, and its  matchups against Sableye and Umbreon become much more tenuous. </p>
		<h3>Ivysaur</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span><span class="type poison">Poison</span>  <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Vine Whip or Razor Leaf  + Power Whip/Sludge Bomb <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Blastoise, Whiscash, Quagsire, Meganium, Tropius <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Alolan Marowak </p>
      <p>Ivysaur and Venusaur are nigh identical Pokemon.  The key difference is Power Whip versus Frenzy Plant (Power Whip is 90 power/50  energy while Frenzy Plant is 100 power/45 energy). It&rsquo;s not a far cry from  Frenzy Plant Venusaur, but the difference is enough to entertain Razor Leaf for  Ivysaur. Note that Ivysaur can&rsquo;t beat Meganium or Tropius with Razor Leaf, so  that&rsquo;s also an important consideration. However, the extra, instant damage  could be valuable especially in a fast-paced environment. Razor Leaf does better  against Sableye in particular. </p>
		<h3>Victreebel</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span><span class="type poison">Poison</span>  <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Razor Leaf + Leaf  Blade/Acid Spray <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Sableye, Haunter <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Charizard, Alolan Marowak, Venusaur </p>
      <p>Razor Leaf is Victreebel&rsquo;s only option, but what  it lacks in conventional utility it makes up for with Acid Spray. A -2 Defense  debuff can drastically change the outcome of a match, making unwinnable  matchups winnable and turning close calls into energy batteries. If you&rsquo;re  concerned about Sableye, Victreebel has a very solid matchup against it with  Acid Spray, and Sableye can't burn shields to save itself. </p>
    </div>

	<a name="meganium"></a>
  <h3 class="article-header">Meganium</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p>While Venusaur has gotten a lot of recent attention,  Meganium is not to be ignored and it means business. High bulk, Frenzy Plant,  and fantastic coverage in Earthquake combine into a versatile Pokemon. Meganium  and Meganium replacements should be able to: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Dominate Water types</li>
        <li>Reliably beat anti-Flying tanks</li>
        <li>Avoid being exploited by Confusion</li>
      </ul>
		<h3>Meganium</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Vine Whip + Frenzy  Plant/Earthquake <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Bastiodon, Probopass, Steelix, Umbreon <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Alolan Marowak, Venusaur, Tropius </p>
      <p>The number of Meganium's &ldquo;key matchups&rdquo; speaks  to its excellent bulk and power. It&rsquo;s too bad that it loses to Venusaur, but  can still give it a fright with Earthquake. In fact, Earthquake is an incredibly  valuable part of its toolkit and soundly beats the like Bastiodon and  Probopass. And while it doesn&rsquo;t resist Fighting attacks like Venusaur can, it  can use its extra bulk to challenge them just the same. </p>
      <p>Another of Meganium&rsquo;s key advantages is it isn&rsquo;t  vulnerable to Confusion. Meganium can overpower typical Confusion users like  Gallade,  and it even has positive matchups against Hypno. </p>
		<h3>Sceptile</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Fury Cutter + Leaf  Blade/Earthquake <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Bastiodon, Probopass, Steelix, Meganium <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Venusaur, Tropius </p>
      <p>For Sceptile, the best defense is a good  offense. It has blinding speed with Fury Cutter and Leaf Blade, and similar to  Meganium, Earthquake devastates Bastiodon and Probopass. Fury Cutter also hits  pure Grass types for super effective damage, not to mention Psychic and Dark  types. Despite its fragileness, Sceptile has a narrow 1-shield win against  Hypno and can shield twice to beat Sableye and Umbreon. </p>
      <p>Sceptile has plenty of other moves to consider  as well. Aerial Ace can threaten Fighting and other Grass types, but Sceptile  doesn&rsquo;t have the stamina to beat these Pokemon head on. It&rsquo;ll need an energy  lead in most cases, but that&rsquo;s something of Sceptile&rsquo;s specialty! Frenzy Plant  is another move to consider. It relegates Sceptile to a closer role, though, and  Sceptile will miss that extra bit of speed from Leaf Blade. (The alternative is to run Leaf Blade and Frenzy Plant together, which gives you maximum Grass flexibility at the expense of any coverage.)</p>
		<h3>Grotle</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Type: </strong><span class="type grass">Grass</span> <br>
        <strong>Moves: </strong>Razor Leaf + Body  Slam/Grass Knot <br>
        <strong>Key Matchups: </strong>Azumarill,  Lanturn, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Sableye <br>
        <strong>Counters: </strong>Skarmory,  Altaria, Noctowl, Venusaur, Tropius </p>
      <p>Grotle stands alongside Bellossom and Bayleaf as  a  pure-Grass Razor Leaf. The other options are bulkier and certainly worth consideration.  One nich draw for Grotle is extra Attack that allows hit to hit a <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/grotle-31-8-6-6-4-4-1/probopass-29-0-15-4-4-4-1/11/1-0-0/1-2-3/">valuable  breakpoint against Probopass</a> (Grotle will want around 121.7 Attack to guarantee the breakpoint). </p>
      <p>Unless you&rsquo;re purposefully looking to burn shields, Grotle should stick to Razor Leaf in most of its matchups and use its  built up energy to Body Slam the next opponent.  </p>
