	<div class="faq-item">
		<h3 class="article-header"><strong>Which Slowpoke evolutions are good in PvP with the addition of Surf?</strong></h3>
		<div class="faq-answer">
			<p><b>Surf is a strong improvement for all four evolutions in the Slowpoke family and gives them top meta potential for future Great League and Ultra League themed cups.</b> As a whole, Slowbro, Slowking, and their Galarian forms have solid stats and typing but up to now have lacked convincing moves to compete. In particular, their movesets feature all high energy Charged Moves. Surf provides much needed speed to the Slowpoke family and expands coverage for the Galarian forms. All four should prefer Surf in PvP going forward.</p>
			<p><b>Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking are recommended as a first priority</b> since Galarian Slowpoke is more difficult to obtain outside of special events. Both are poised to succeed in Great League and Ultra League themed cups. Galarian Slowbro is equipped to handle rival Poison types while Galarian Slowking has play against rival Psychic types with its Ghost coverage.</p>
			<p><b>Kanto Slowbro is another strong priority and should see similar improvement in Great League and Ultra League themed cups.</b> Slowbro may also find an anti-meta niche in the current Open Great League where it resists all of Medicham's Charged Moves. Slowbro has a shadow variant worth considering as wellâ€”if you have any Shadow Slowpoke with Frustration removed, look to obtain Shadow Slowbro with Surf during the event. Lastly, Mega Slowbro will notably improve in Mega Master League with Surf and is worth pursuing if you're a dedicated Master League Factions or draft player.</p>
			<p><b>Kanto Slowking is the lowest priority and generally worse than Slowbro.</b> Its movepool features more expensive Charged Moves (Blizzard and Fire Blast instead of Ice Beam). There may be niche situations where these are useful, but Slowbro is likely to be preferred over Slowking barring future move updates. Slowking will still be best with Surf than without it.</p>
