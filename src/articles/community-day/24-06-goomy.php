		<h3 class="article-header"><strong>How good is Goodra with Thunder Punch in PvP?</strong></h3>
		<div class="faq-answer">
			<p><b>Thunder Punch is on par with Goodra's other Charged Move options and is most valuable in Great League.</b> Goodra is among the bulkier Dragons and packs interesting coverage between Aqua Tail and Power Whip. With Thunder Punch, Goodra gains unique Electric coverage for key targets like Skarmory, Azumarill, and other strong Water types.</p>
			<p>While Thunder Punch has its benefits, it isn't a strict upgrade for Goodra and doesn't solve its main setbacks. Goodra lacks closing power without Draco Meteor and its coverage moves are all resisted by rival Dragon types. Because of this, Goodra will most likely fulfill an anti-meta, corebreaking role in the open leagues and take a backseat to the likes of Altaria, Dragonair, and Guzzlord in themed cups where Dragon types are strong.</p>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<h3 class="article-header"><strong>Which moveset should I use for Goodra?</strong></h3>
		<div class="faq-answer">
			<p><b>Goodra has multiple viable movesets, preferably Aqua Tail plus another coverage move. Your choice may depend on your team and personal preferences.</b> Below are Goodra's main moveset combinations, their advantages, and disadvantages.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u>Aqua Tail/Thunder Punch -</u> Goodra's fastest moveset with the broadest coverage. Water and Electric complement each other well, resisted only by Grass and Dragon which aren't super prevalent. This Goodra can substitute for your team's Electric type, gaining advantage against them in return. However, it lacks closing power and falls short in neutral matchups.</li>
				<li><u>Aqua Tail/Power Whip -</u> Power Whip is super effective against Water types just like Thunder Punch, but crucially targets Lanturn and Water/Ground types. This moveset best compliments teammates who need to ward off these two, such as Skarmory, Bastiodon, or Skeledirge. Power Whip is also notably stronger than Aqua Tail or Thunder Punch, improving Goodra's neutral matchups. However, Aqua Tail and Power Whip share some redundant coverage and will struggle more against Skarmory and Altaria.</li>
				<li><u>Aqua Tail/Draco Meteor -</u> Draco Meteor packs major closing power which other movesets lack, and a surprise factor that will only improve after Community Day. This moveset gives Goodra the most neutral play. It's also Goodra's slowest moveset, sacrifices its corebreaking potential, and loses effectiveness in tournament play where movesets are known.</li>
			</ul>
