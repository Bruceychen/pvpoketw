Lower Attack investment in this range makes winning CMP against these Pokemon less likely in the order listed. \n\n This specific IV combination reaches a Vine Whip breakpoint, a Powder Snow bulkpoint, and wins CMP against very high rank Froslass. All of these together allow Chesnaught to beat Froslass head to head in the 1s and 2s scenario."
