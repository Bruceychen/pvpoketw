		<h2 style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;">For California Residents: CCPA Information</h2>

		<p>This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Notice and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; or
			&ldquo;you&rdquo;). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>
		<h4>Rights and Choices</h4>
		<p>The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California with certain rights regarding their personal information and data. The following section describes those rights and explains how to exercise them:</p>
		<h4>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h4>
		<p>You have the right to request that the company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (as described in
			the section &ldquo;Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights&rdquo;), we will disclose to you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
			<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
			<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
			<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
			<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called data portability request)</li>
			<li>If we sold or disclose your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
			<li>Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased, and</li>
			<li>Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Non-Discrimination</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</li>
			<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
			<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or imposing penalties.</li>
			<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
			<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level of quality of goods or services.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your value and contain written terms that describe the program&rsquo;s material aspects.</p>
		<h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
		<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at ads@ggsoftware.io</p>
		<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on
			behalf of your minor child.</p>
		<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access of data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
			<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
		<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity or authority to make the request.
		</p>
		<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
		<p>Our websites, emails (with your consent, where required by law), and other products, services and platforms collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be
			linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (&ldquo;personal information&rdquo;). In particular, our websites, apps, emails, and other products, services and platforms may have collected the following categories of
