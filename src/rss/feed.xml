			<title>Custom Ranking Fixes</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the custom rankings tool with some fixes and features that significantly speed up the time it takes to generate results. Under the "Advanced" settings, there's a new option that excludes low-performing Pokemon (Pokemon which have an overall score of less than 70 in the open league rankings). Depending on the cup, this can reduce the number of simulations required by up to half. The tool is much faster in general now, especially for "open" style formats.]]>

			<title>Goodra Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Goodra is getting Thunder Punch for its Community Day, expanding its coverage options. In terms of overall performance, Thunder Punch appears on par with Power Whip or Draco Meteor for Great League, while it has fewer targets in Ultra League. Which moveset you choose may depend on your team and personal preferences. Make sure to grab Thunder Punch Goodra this weekend just in case!]]>

			<title>Next Season Preview</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Next season's PvP updates have been revealed, and the site is now updated with preview rankings which include the changes. Most notably, Spark and Scald nerfs should dial back Lanturn and Whiscash in Great League. The move updates don't have much immediate impact alone, but these small but important changes could open the door for meta shifts as teams adjust.<br><br>Note that next season's move updates will go live on June 3rd, after the weekend's Play!

			<title>Site Update 1.31.9</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site has been updated with a few new features and fixes:<br><br>- In single battles, you can select "1 turn switch" under a Pokemon's options to simulate the battle with 1 turn of delay for that Pokemon. The optimal move timing guide also reflects the 1 turn delay.<br>- Matchup differences in Matrix Battle are now color coded with the gradient to reflect which differences are hard wins, soft wins, etc.<br>- Fixed an issue where battle time was being calculated incorrectly for mirror matchups.]]>

			<title>New Ultra Beast Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Three new Ultra Beasts are coming, including Stakataka, Blacephalon, and Naganadel, which can evolve from Poipole. Unfortunately, none of them are noteworthy for PvP at this time. Blacephalon and Naganadel suffer from incredibly low stat product while Stakataka doesn't have the moves to stand out. Keep a lookout for more Ultra Beasts in the future!]]>

			<title>Catch Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are now available for Catch Cup (Great League Edition). These rankings implement usage data from the first few days to highlight which Pokemon may have an advantage in the current meta. For example, Carbink has strong matchups against popular Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mantine, Skeledirge, and Charjabug. As always, Catch Cup is restricted to the best Pokemon available to you, so your mileage may vary. Good luck the rest of the season!]]>

			<title>Tsareena Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[It's Bounsweet Community Day this weekend, and Tsareena will receive a new move, High Jump Kick. This Fighting-type nuke has a 10% chance to lower your Defense by 4 stages, so it comes with a big risk. Tsareena seems to be best with Triple Axel and High Jump Kick. However, it struggles to stand out among stronger Grass types like Abomasnow or Chesnaught, who benefit from STAB. I'd recommend obtaining High Jump Kick Tsareena just in case!]]>

			<title>Tapu Fini Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Tapu Fini is the last to receive Nature's Madness, and it's a notable buff for the Water/Fairy Pokemon! Nature's Madness isn't as powerful as Moonblast, but the lower energy cost and the guaranteed Defense drop make Tapu Fini more flexible and dynamic. It's worth grabbing Tapu Fini if you don't have one already, and Nature's Madness is worthy of an Elite TM.]]>

			<title>Rankings Performance Comparison</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've added a small new feature that lets you compare the "Performance" details of two Pokemon in the rankings. Click the "Compare" button to select a Pokemon, and then you'll be able to compare their performance charts and numbers for each ranking category. You can use this to compare two similar Pokemon or two forms (such as Shadow vs non-Shadow).]]>

			<title>Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[This season's Great League Remix bans several of the league's most infamous Pokemon, while others such as Gligar and Annihilape slip through the cracks. Similar to previous Remixes, Dragon, Dark, and Ice-type Pokemon stand to gain from banning the strongest Steels and Fairies. Empoleon, Steelix, Carbink, and Alolan Ninetales look ready to step up to the plate but face their fair share of challenges as well.<br><br>One of the biggest questions is which Electric types will fill the gap left by Lanturn and Charjabug? Magnezone has seen recent tournament success while Dedenne could potentially thrive in an anti-meta role thanks to its Fairy typing. Good luck preparing!]]>

			<title>Master Premier and Tapu Bulu Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are now available for Master Premier Cup, which returns in a few weeks! It will feature several Pokemon new to the format, including Annihilape, Feraligatr, Skeledirge, and Golisopod. While Dragonite, Gyarados, and Fairies should continue to define the meta, these new picks will look at add some twists and corebreakers. Good luck preparing!<br><br>In regular Master League, Tapu Bulu is debuting with its exclusive move, Nature's Madness. Tapu Bulu has higher stat product compared to some of its companions, and its typing gives it a potential niche against both Dragon types and Kyogre. Unfortunately, its struggles against Dialga and Ho-oh may limit it in the current meta.]]>
