			<title>Leavanny Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Sewaddle Community Day this Saturday brings Shadow Claw to Leavanny! It'll be a spicy pick that may even see some themed cup play thanks to Leaf Blade and X-Scissor, both powerful 35-energy attacks. It won't stick around the battlefield for a long time, but it'll be a fun one!]]>

			<title>Sunshine Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Sunshine Cup returns for the new season in just a few weeks! With Vigoroth's time in the sun expired, Normal types look notably safe this time around. Great League favorites like Clodsire, Talonflame, and Gastrodon should see plenty of play, too. Grass will be a vital type in this meta, in particular Abomasnow and Chesnaught should find plenty of cores to break.]]>

			<title>Galar Cup Rankings and Other Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted initial rankings for Galar Cup! Bulky Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Diggersby, and Toxapex stand to form the core of the meta, but watch for old favorites like Charjabug, Lanturn, and Alolan Ninetales to make a return.<br><br>Elsewhere, I've tweaked energy values for Incinerate users in the Safe Switch scenario so they're better represented, and added a separate ranking entry for Sludge Bomb Clodsire. Like Lanturn in the past, Clodsire is central to the meta and its multiple viable movesets allow for different team building opportunities.]]>

			<title>Rapidash Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Both Rapidash improve with the addition of Wild Charge this Community Day. Kanto Rapidash stands out more in Ultra League where it has more relative bulk to work with and can take on the rival Fire type, Talonflame. In Psychic Cup, Megahorn is the better option for Galarian Rapidash on paper, but there are sure to be many Wild Chargers about after Community Day!<br><br>Make sure to grab one of each and enjoy the event!]]>

			<title>Psychic Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Psychic Cup returns in just over a week, and this condensed meta comes with a few twists courtesy of the recent move update. Malamar is the first Pokemon that comes to mind, and it also has to contend with buffs for Claydol and Galarian Slowbro. Galarian Rapidash looks like will remain a top pick, although it won't benefit much in Psychic Cup from its upcoming Community Day. There are also a couple of unique Astonish users such as Beheeyem and Hoopa who could see some play. We'll see what the future holds!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted a first look at training analysis for Great League! This data comes super early into the season, so it's only a small snapshot so far. The meta has shaped around Clodsire, Mandibuzz, Feraligatr, Gastrodon, and Dunsparce, and top individual performers against them include Malamar, Jumpluff, and Serperior. In fact, Grass is a common element among many of the top performing teams, as Gastrodon and Feraligatr face few threats without them. With a dearth of Ice types, Clodsire + Grass and Clodsire + Flying seem to be the current successful team template, but look for that to change as Dewgong and Alolan Sandslash claw their way into the meta.]]>

			<title>New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[New Shadows are debuting, including Shadow Cresselia! The Shadow version sacrifices its signature bulk for extra attack power. While Cresselia isn't the best Pokemon to take advantage of the Shadow boost, its Shadow version is still strong and worth using if you don't have access to regular Cresselia. Stay tuned for the World Championship event where you will be able to catch a regular Cresselia in special research as well!]]>

			<title>Fossil Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fossil Cup returns next week, and looks to center around Poliwrath and Ferrothorn. These two face few corebreakers except for Quaquaval, who could see anti-meta play. Electric types like Lanturn and Magnezone should also prove crucial if they can avoid Grass. We'll have this cup for two weeks so there will be plenty of time to dig up the meta!]]>

			<title>Great and Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated training analysis for Great and Ultra League with the past few weeks of data. In Great League, things look relatively stable although note that some Remix practice may impact this dataset. Water Gun Lanturn and Quagsire are still proving to be top options, while top teams are trending more toward Fast Attack pressure with the likes of Wigglytuff, Victreebel, Bastiodon, and Dragonair.]]>

			<title>Eelektross Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Tynamo Community Day is this weekend, and Eelektross will receive the Fast Attack Volt Switch. Eelektross is best with Volt Switch, but unfortunately won't be meta relevant over other Electric picks like Charjabug, Lanturn, or Magnezone. Catch a few just in case!]]>

			<title>Master League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Master League top performers have been updated with results from the site's training battles so far this season. Both Dawn Wings and Dusk Mane Necrozma have put on impressive debuts, topping the individual and team lists. Now that both are globally available, we may see Master League go through some upheaval to adjust, including a clearer role for Yveltal.<br><br>]]>

			<title>Custom Group Transformations</title>

				<![CDATA[When you work with custom groups in Multi-Battle or Matrix Battle, the "IVs" options have now been reworked to apply the selected option to the whole group. This includes a "best buddy" option to set all members of a group to level 51 for Master League.]]>

			<title>Fantasy Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fantasy Cup (Great League Edition) returns in a few weeks for Dragon, Fairy, and Steel types to clash. This format has few changes from its run earlier this year, so teams from January should work just as well now. <br><br>Steel Wing and Shadow Empoleon are the biggest additions, resisting all moves from Azumarill and putting up a fight against Dragons and Galarian Stunfisk. Tapu Fini now has Nature's Madness as well, closing the gap between it and Azumarill and making ABB teams with both more potent. Lastly, Thunder Punch is arguably a better coverage move for Lucario than Blaze Kick, but both are viable options.]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The first training analysis of the season highlights Water Gun Lanturn, Quagsire, and Goodra as new elements to the meta. While this season doesn't have too many changes, some familiar faces are bringing new tricks. Fire types like Skeledirge and Typhlosion are also standing surprisingly strong against the Water types, and old favorites like Umbreon and Sableye appear to have a chance for a comeback.<br><br>Among the top performing teams, a Normal type such as Lickitung or Vigoroth seems to be the common glue holding these teams together. Both Pokemon are flexible and favor neutral play. At the same time, Fast Attack pressure teams with Bastiodon, Victreebel, Wigglytuff, Dragonair, and similar picks are also standing the test of time against the early season. Best of luck the rest of the week!]]>
