			<title>Skeledirge Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fuecoco has a big Community Day this weekend, where Skeledirge will be receiving Blast Burn as an exclusive move and Torch Song as a regular addition to its movepool. Blast Burn is the Fire-type nuke we all know, while Torch Song is an Attack-boosting move that's slightly stronger Flame Charge, dealing more damage and costing less energy. Skeledirge is a top Fire type in Great League and Ultra League, and should see renewed play with its new moveset options. It also has some niche play in Master Premier, so look to evolve one for each league.<br><br>Skeledirge now has multiple viable moveset options. It previously ran Disarming Voice + Shadow Ball as its preferred Charged Attacks. Fairy + Ghost provide near perfect coverage, able to hit any Pokemon in the metagame for neutral damage. Some may continue to opt for this moveset depending on the meta, however Torch Song or Blast Burn now provide greater damage output and a higher performance ceiling.<br><br>At an initial glance, the STAB combination of Torch Song + Shadow Ball appears to be the most likely moveset going forward. It still provides a wide degree of coverage (walled only by Guzzlord in the meta), and Torch Song boosts Skeledirge's performance to higher levels! For example, boosted Torch Song is about as strong as super effective Disarming Voice, and boosted Shadow Ball is about as strong as unboosted Blast Burn. This moveset only sees drawbacks in metas with heavy a Dragon-type presence where there's a two-stage difference in effectiveness between Disarming Voice and Torch Song.<br><br>Blast Burn is Skeledirge's strongest attack. However, Torch Song + Blast Burn leaves it with no coverage. Sometimes even resisted Blast Burn is better than neutral attacks on other Pokemon, but STAB Shadow Ball is strong enough that Blast Burn isn't the de facto attack on Skeledirge. Blast Burn has slightly faster pacing than Shadow Ball and can be doubled up, so there are some advantages to running it.<br><br>Even if you don't plan to use Blast Burn, look to evolve multiple Skeledirge so you have the option. This is a big Community Day for PvP, so have fun and good luck!]]>

			<title>Scroll Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Scroll Cup takes place next week, featuring the three types in the Kubfu family - Dark, Fighting, and Water. You won't have to scroll far to find your Pokemon for this cup because it's a pretty limited meta. Great League standouts like Azumarill, Mandibuzz, and Annihilape will be taking on vital counterpicks like Chesnaught, Lanturn, and Jellicent. Dark-type attacks are resisted by two of the featured types, so Mandibuzz and others may lean toward alternate movesets that provide more neutral play.]]>

			<title>Might and Mastery Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site is updated for the Season of Might and Mastery! Willpower Cup rankings are now available, and Scroll Cup rankings are coming soon.<br><br>This season brings a ton of move updates and will certainly shake up the meta. Some of the biggest winners include Lapras, Grumpig, and Claydol with major buffs or attack updates. As a previous meta staple, Lapras likely has the longest staying power and looks to overthrow Dewgong and Feraligatr in similar roles. Meanwhile, Galarian Corsola is no longer the sole and supreme Ghost-type. Multiple Ghosts including Sableye, Jellicent, Dusclops, and Dusknoir received updates which can push them into the metagame.<br><br>There's a lot to take in, so have fun in the early season! Stay tuned for more updates on upcoming cups and tournament results.]]>

			<title>Might and Mastery Preview</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[New GO Battle League updates have been announced for next season, and they're a doozy! Next season will bring a ton of attack updates and movepool additions. A preview site is now available to check out speculative rankings in Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. Some attack changes won't be confirmed until the new season starts on Tuesday, so keep an eye out for further updates then. Time to study up!]]>

			<title>Master Premier Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Last minute, Niantic removed Mega Master League from the cup rotation and replaced it with Master Premier Cup. Two years ago, the last rotation of Mega Master League had to be pulled due to a bug where players could field multiple Mega Evolutions on their team, so it may be that this bug was not fixed despite Niantic placing Mega Master League on the schedule for this season.<br><br>Master Premier has only marginal changes from last season. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch are slightly stronger now, so Goodra performs even better. Expect to run into Annihilape and Ursaluna wielding the Punches as well. For the intrepid trainer, Dragapult is an intriguing option as Ghost types are slim pickings.<br><br>Good luck the rest of the season and see you for the next one! I'll look to post preview rankings if updates are announced in the next few days.]]>

			<title>Update on Unova Legendaries</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[In contrast to previous research encounters, the legendary Pokemon in the Road to Unova Timed Research are encountered at level 20 and not level 15. This means that Pokemon like Cobalion and Virizion from these research encounters will not be Great League eligible! Following this, I've removed them from the Great League rankings.]]>

			<title>Black and White Kyurem Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Barring any prerelease changes, Black and White Kyurem should redefine the circle of power in Master League. They join Zygarde Complete, Origin Palkia, and Origin Dialga in the highest tier of Legendaries. Their immense stat product is punctuated by their enormous Attack stat, which guarantees Charged Attack priority against all other Pokemon in the meta. On top of this, their movesets include the powerful attacks Fusion Bolt (Black) and Fusion Flare (White), plus their exclusive Ice-type attacks, Freeze Shock (Black) and Ice Burn (White).<br><br>Both Legendaries have unique matchup profiles. Black Kyurem should prefer Shadow Claw for faster pacing to its hard-hitting Charged Attacks, while White Kyurem should prefer Ice Fang to capitalize on prevalent Ice weaknesses in the meta. Black Kyurem is the more flexible of the two with vaunted Electric + Ice coverage. Meanwhile, White Kyurem has more polarizing wins but also more polarizing losses.<br><br>Which version you lean toward may depend on your playstyle and your current Master League roster. Black Kyurem operates best as a safe swap (for example, on an ABB team alongside Dusk Mane + Palkia). White Kyurem can be a high pressure lead with support from Ground or Fairy to cover its weaknesses.]]>

			<title>Top Performers Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[All three leagues are returning, and I've updated the top performers for all three in case you need any team ideas for the final stretch of the season.<br><br>In Great League, Corviknight has made a quiet debut. While it put up solid numbers in training, it's not finding footing on many teams. There were a lot of Annihilape experiments over the past month, and a rise in Shadow Marowak. Water continues to be a defining theme of top teams, with Dewgong and Feraligatr as the primary picks.<br><br>In Ultra League, some XL picks like Steelix, Gastrodon, Drifblim, and Malamar are gaining ground while Legendary mainstays such as Giratina, Cresselia, and the Swords of Justice take a backseat. Drifblim + Gastrodon was a major theme in the past month of training, plus a heavy dose of Shadow Feraligatr and Lickilicky.<br><br>Lastly in Master League, Enamorus made a big debut as it appeared in raids for the first time. Common pairings include Origin Palkia and Ho-oh. Master League is looking at a major shift soon with the release of Black and White Kyurem, so these top performers might not have a long shelf life.<br><br>Good luck the rest of the season and enjoy Unova Tour!]]>

			<title>Mega Master League Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The final week of the season will include the Mega Edition of Master League, barring any of the technical barriers from its previous run. You'll be able to add one Mega Evolution to your team, including Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. These two plus the master of their trio, Mega Rayquaza, dominated last time around and should be the standout picks again.<br><br>There are a few wrinkles outside of the obvious choices. Mega Salamence is comparable to Mega Rayquaza if you lack the resources for the latter. Mega Gardevoir with access to Triple Axel will be able to mow down any Dragon type in its way, but will need protection from Fire and Steel. To that end, Mega Scizor with Trailblaze and Mega Aggron with Meteor Beam may see some niche play.<br><br>Outside of the Megas, typical Master League picks like Palkia, Dialga, and Necrozma should still find play here. Teams that pass on Mega Rayquaza may look to Dragonite as a non-Mega alternative, but watch out as even resisted attacks from Mega Evolutions will threaten shields.<br><br>One major note is these rankings don't yet include Black and White Kyurem, whose moves aren't finalized yet. Their base stats eclipse those of regular Pokemon and are almost as powerful as Megas in their own right, so look for these two to make a major impact in regular Master League and in this one.]]>

			<title>Dhelmise Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Dhelmise debuts in Raid Battles during the upcoming event. As a Ghost and Grass-type Pokemon, it draws comparisons to both Trevenant and Decidueye. Currently, Dhelmise falls well short of them both. It has the lowest stat product of the three, and while it has access to both Shadow Claw and Astonish, its Charged Attack pool gives it little room to maneuver. It will need a future move update to see play.]]>

			<title>Love Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Love Cup returns this week, and a lot has changed since its last appearance! Galarian Slowbro, Hisuian Electrode, Alomomola, and Talonflame are among the staples that will keep their roses. Watch for Lickilicky to make a big impact with its bulk, spam, and a moveset that's largely unresisted. Other hopeful newcomers include Solrock, Skeledirge, and Clefable.<br><br>Despite major nerfs, Medicham and Scrafty should still see play as rare counters to the format's Normal types.]]>

			<title>Little Jungle Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Little Jungle Cup returns for the first time since the major move shakeup. New faces like Fletchling and Cubone enter the fray alongside old favorites such as Skorupi and Steelix. Most Little Cups involve heavy Fast Attack pressure, so watch out for Charm and Mud Slap to chew through teams. Cottonee and Wigglytuff are the main Fairy culprits while Cubone and Golett form the Ground contingent. Skorupi has play against both sides, so it should remain a centerpiece of the meta.<br><br>Note that while Shuckle and Smeargle aren't mentioned in the blog, they were banned in previous editions of Little Jungle Cup. I'll update the rankings if they're included this time.]]>

			<title>Corviknight Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Barring any further move tweaks, Corviknight should debut as a new core meta Pokemon in Great and Ultra League. It soars above Skarmory with a significantly better movepool, including Sand Attack and Payback. These moves give it coverage which Skarmory never had against Steel and Electric counters, plus the ability to hit itself for neutral damage. All three of Corviknight's Charged Attacks are viable, so look to obtain one with its exclusive move, Iron Head, during its debut event.<br><br>Unlike Skarmory, Corviknight forms less polarizing cores. Corviknight + Water/Ground cores are threatened by other Flying types, while Sand Attack over Steel Wing gives Ice types more play against it.<br><br>Corviknight should mark a major meta shift in Great League and Ultra League, which have enjoyed a lack of dominant Flying types for a few seasons. Grass and Bug types like Serperior and Ariados are the most severely threatened, while Poison types like Clodsire and Toxapex may see reduced play. Electric and Fire types will likely see increased usage, so keep an eye out for Pokemon like Unova Stunfisk, Morpeko, Talonflame, and Shadow Typhlosion to be on the rise.]]>

			<title>New Shadows and Grafaiai Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A batch of new Shadows are coming next Rocket Takeover, and a lot of them are highly relevant for PvP! Meta favorites Diggersby and Serperior now have Shadow forms to add an extra layer to team building. Overall, both look like downgrades compared to their normal forms since their biggest advantage is their bulk. That said, definitely look to catch and ready these Pokemon during the event.<br><br>Shadow Palkia is the featured legendary Pokemon. In Master League, it's about even with normal Palkia. However, the Origin form is far and away superior to both. If you're holding onto Palkia XL Candy, you're much better off saving it for Palkia Origin. In the meantime, Shadow Palkia makes for wild spice in Great League where it's eligible for the first time.<br><br>The Poison/Normal Pokemon Grafaiai debuts in 12km eggs during this event. It has lackluster moves and stats, but one potential niche as a Poison type with access to Mud Slap. This could give it play in future themed cups that include Poison types.]]>

			<title>Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[We're just over a month through the season, and today's update focuses on Ultra League top performers. I've updated training analysis with the sampling of Ultra League battles so far, so take a look for potential Pokemon and team ideas!<br><br>There aren't many shakeups in Ultra League this season, but some trainers found success with Bulldoze on Zygarde Complete. If you happen to have access to this rare Pokemon, it has a few different viable movesets. Zygarde is just about the only Pokemon that can make Bulldoze work thanks to its enormous stat product.<br><br>Top team data is limited. Common threads include Water types like Feraligatr, Greninja, or Gastrodon paired with Poison types like Shadow Drapion or Galarian Weezing. Drifblim is also a notable top individual and team performer.<br><br>Good luck in your battles and stay tuned, there are some exciting PvP Pokemon on the horizon!]]>
