			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Training Analysis has been updated with an early look at the Great League meta! The meta is still developing, and so far some of the obvious suspects top the charts including Lanturn and Skarmory. Talonflame neither overperformed nor underperformed, perhaps thanks to a surge in Lanturn and a developing Dragon anti-meta.<br><br>One big surprise is a plummet in both Sableye usage and performance. Its key target, Medicham, has been nerfed this season, coupled with a buff to Azumarill has spelled trouble for Sableye in the early goings.<br><br>Thanks for your hard practice and good luck through the start of the season!]]>

			<title>Holiday Cup Rankings Added</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings for the Great League Holiday Cup are now available! Vigoroth should prove to be even more dominant than before, and Talonflame, Lanturn, and Skarmory will continue their Great League tango here. Some new picks also enter the mix including Skeledirge, Charjabug, and Arctibax to serve as potential corebreakers. Study up before the weather outside gets frightful and stay tuned for Little Holiday Cup rankings next week!]]>

			<description>

			<title>Site Updated for Season of Timeless Travels!</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The website is updated with the move changes for Season of Timeless Travels! Rankings, battle simulations, and the team builder now include the latest changes for this season. Retro Cup rankings are also now available, and Holiday Cup rankings will be coming shortly. You can expect a top performer update on the Training Analysis page after the first week of the season.<br><br>For this season, I've included two entries for Lanturn in the Great League rankingsâ€”one with Spark and one with Water Gun. Lanturn is the only Pokemon to be featured this way given its importance in the metagame, but I'll be considering how to expand this for the future.<br><br>Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Added Hisuian Starters</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Hisuian starter Pokemon are now available on the site, with Hisuian Samurott making its debut this Sunday! Note that these Pokemon do not have their Community Day exclusive moves available via Elite TM at this time. Hisuian Samurott will need to wait for Hydro Cannon to see much viability, and even then it's unlikely to surpass Greninja.<br><br>With this update, I've also fixed an issue where navigating directly to Multi-Battle would show results against all Pokemon instead of just the meta Pokemon.]]>

			<title>Custom Moves to Preview New Season Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[If you're looking to get a peek at next season's updates, I've added duplicates of the moves which are receiving changes so you can use them in the simulations. Some of these values are speculative since energy values won't be known until the season begins on Friday. A full site update will come then!]]>

				<![CDATA[The latest season and move updates have been announced! There is a lot to explore with nerfs to Psychic, buffs for Fire types, and wide move distributions for Trailblaze, Scald, Fly, and more.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[Ultra League top performers have been updated with the past month of training data. Golisopod has continued to prove its part in the meta, and top teams are showing variety with Cresselia and Steelix as common anchors in the back. Take a look!]]>

			<title>Site Update 1.31.0 - RSS News Feed</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Site updates will now appear in a news feed on the homepage! I've previously posted these updates to Twitter, but as Twitter has become less accessible, I've been looking to make them available on the website itself.

			<title>Mega Garchomp Added</title>

				<![CDATA[Mega Garchomp has been added to the main site! It boasts incredible stats, but lives in Rayquaza's shadow, and has tough moveset choices to make. Happy raiding!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Coming at you with a mid-week top performer update featuring Clodsire! Mud Shot has an early lead over Poison Sting, but overall, multiple movesets look viable. Dewgong and Jellicent stand to gain if Clodsire hangs around (and Regi doesn't).]]>

			<title>Bellibolt Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Bellibolt has been added to the rankings. It's bulkier than most Electric types with play in both Great and Ultra League. Unfortunately it lacks any coverage, so it will be hindered until a future update. Few can say that Bellibolt doesn't spark joy, though!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers with data from the past few weeks of Great League training. With Medicham, Sableye, Lickitung, and Serperior all solidifying their places in the meta, Noctowl showed strong anti-meta potential. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[A PvP guide for Wooper Community Day is now available! Both evolutions are excellent additions for your roster. I've included some specialized IV spreads for the Clodsire mirror matchup, and a Quagsire spread that's more consistent
