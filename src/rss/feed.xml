			<title>Updated Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[With GO Battle Weekend beginning tomorrow, I've updated the Training Analysis page with top performers from the past few weeks of Great League practice. The Pokemon topping the charts are by and large established meta at this point, although Morpeko and even Pangoro put up some good recent numbers. Clodsire dominates the top performing teams, most often partnered with a Water type such as Feraligatr, Azumarill, or Gastrodon. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Site Performance Improvements</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've launched performance improvements to the Rankings page which should now be faster and more lightweight. If you notice any freezing, lag, or slowdown, you can also enable a new Performance Mode option from the Settings page, which further improves CPU performance on the Rankings page.]]>

			<title>Willpower Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Willpower Cup returns featuring Dark, Psychic, and Fighting-type Pokemon. Gardevoir is banned, but other Fairies sneak through, including Hatterene and Galarian Rapidash. With few resistances, Charm could be a running theme, but Poison Jab and Poison Sting are strong enough to overcome it. Some niche Pokemon like Claydol should also see play. Have fun!]]>

			<title>Morpeko Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Morpeko will debut as the first Pokemon to change forms mid-battle! This form change occurs whenever it uses a Charged Attack. Depending on its form, its powerful signature move, Aura Wheel, is either an Electric-type or Dark-type attack.<br><br>Morpeko fits the mold of other glassy Electric types like Magnezone, Togedemaru, and Luxray, equipped with a bait move and a powerful nuke. It's likely to remain spice but should be fun to experiment with. We'll see if the form change mechanic comes to other Pokemon in the future!]]>

			<title>Expanded Multi-Battle and Matrix Battle Options</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The groups you set for Multi-Battle and Matrix Battle now feature the same simulation options as Single Battle, such as starting HP, starting energy, and stat modifiers. You can use these options to explore advanced scenarios, such as which Pokemon can beat Clodsire after switching in, or breakpoints between different IV spreads when you have an Attack buff. Enjoy tinkering around!]]>

			<title>Updated Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers data for all three leagues from training so far this season. Note that Ultra and Master League training data is limited, so your mileage may vary with the top performing teams!]]>

			<title>Halloween Cup and Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted initial rankings for Halloween Cup and Great League Remix! Halloween Cup has fewer dramatic changes, with Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Azumarill, and Drapion still taking the spotlight. Clodsire is in the mix now too, so expect it to shape the meta going forward.<br><br>Great League Remix now bans top picks from the current season instead of the previous season. However, expect some of those previous season mainstays to make an appearance! Whiscash is one of the strongest Water types left standing, while Bastiodon, Registeel, and potentially even Lanturn are also in play.]]>

			<title>New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A new batch of Shadow Pokemon are debuting! The Mankey family is the most noteworthy with a Community Day coming later this month. Shadow Primeape improves to be a viable contender alongside Machamp and Pangoro, and it may want to consider the legacy move Cross Chop. Annihilape will have to wait for future moves to be relevant again, but its Shadow version is well worth obtaining during the event! Meanwhile, Heatran looks like a slight improvement over the non-Shadow and is a rare chance to obtain one for Great League. Obstagoon, Escavalier, and Scolipede are likewise worth grabbing in case of future move changes.]]>

			<title>Leavanny Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Sewaddle Community Day this Saturday brings Shadow Claw to Leavanny! It'll be a spicy pick that may even see some themed cup play thanks to Leaf Blade and X-Scissor, both powerful 35-energy attacks. It won't stick around the battlefield for a long time, but it'll be a fun one!]]>

			<title>Sunshine Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Sunshine Cup returns for the new season in just a few weeks! With Vigoroth's time in the sun expired, Normal types look notably safe this time around. Great League favorites like Clodsire, Talonflame, and Gastrodon should see plenty of play, too. Grass will be a vital type in this meta, in particular Abomasnow and Chesnaught should find plenty of cores to break.]]>

			<title>Galar Cup Rankings and Other Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted initial rankings for Galar Cup! Bulky Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Diggersby, and Toxapex stand to form the core of the meta, but watch for old favorites like Charjabug, Lanturn, and Alolan Ninetales to make a return.<br><br>Elsewhere, I've tweaked energy values for Incinerate users in the Safe Switch scenario so they're better represented, and added a separate ranking entry for Sludge Bomb Clodsire. Like Lanturn in the past, Clodsire is central to the meta and its multiple viable movesets allow for different team building opportunities.]]>

			<title>Rapidash Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Both Rapidash improve with the addition of Wild Charge this Community Day. Kanto Rapidash stands out more in Ultra League where it has more relative bulk to work with and can take on the rival Fire type, Talonflame. In Psychic Cup, Megahorn is the better option for Galarian Rapidash on paper, but there are sure to be many Wild Chargers about after Community Day!<br><br>Make sure to grab one of each and enjoy the event!]]>

			<title>Psychic Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Psychic Cup returns in just over a week, and this condensed meta comes with a few twists courtesy of the recent move update. Malamar is the first Pokemon that comes to mind, and it also has to contend with buffs for Claydol and Galarian Slowbro. Galarian Rapidash looks like will remain a top pick, although it won't benefit much in Psychic Cup from its upcoming Community Day. There are also a couple of unique Astonish users such as Beheeyem and Hoopa who could see some play. We'll see what the future holds!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted a first look at training analysis for Great League! This data comes super early into the season, so it's only a small snapshot so far. The meta has shaped around Clodsire, Mandibuzz, Feraligatr, Gastrodon, and Dunsparce, and top individual performers against them include Malamar, Jumpluff, and Serperior. In fact, Grass is a common element among many of the top performing teams, as Gastrodon and Feraligatr face few threats without them. With a dearth of Ice types, Clodsire + Grass and Clodsire + Flying seem to be the current successful team template, but look for that to change as Dewgong and Alolan Sandslash claw their way into the meta.]]>
