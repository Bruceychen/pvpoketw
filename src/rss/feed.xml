			<title>Fantasy Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fantasy Cup returns in a few weeks, this time in Great League! This cup includes Dragon, Steel, and Fairy types with no bans. At first glance, Registeel + Azumarill and Galarian Stunfisk + Azumarill are the cores to look out for with few corebreakers between them. Overall, Fantasy Cup will likely be a concentrated meta which has an emphasis on mirror matchups. Prepare your sword and shield accordingly!]]>

			<title>Added Frenzy Plant Decidueye</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[During Community Day on January 6th, Decidueye will debut with the exclusive move, Frenzy Plant, alongside its signature move, Spirit Shackle. Frenzy Plant will be enough to make Decidueye playable, but it will generally fall behind Trevenant in viability. It does have some advantages with its Grass oriented attacks, which make it better against Normal types and bulky Water types.<br><br>Presently, Spirit Shackle has low enough power that resisted Frenzy Plants are still better. If Spirit Shackle remains as is, Brave Bird is likely to be preferred as the secondary move instead. Time permitting, I'll be looking to post a brief article for Decidueye Community Day soon!]]>

			<title>Top Performers Updated for All Leagues</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[All three leagues return today, and I've updated the top performers page with data from the past several weeks of training. In Great League, Shadow Dragonair was the star of the show as a corebreaker to popular picks like Lanturn and Talonflame, while Skarmory dropped in performance. Will the meta developments from Play Pokemon tournaments carry over to GO Battle League? If so, expect more Charjabug, Lickitung, and Poliwrath to take the field.]]>

			<title>Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Great League Remix will be making a return in January! The banlist allows some powerful new picks to slip through the cracks, including Skarmory, Vigoroth, and Swampert. Only a handful of Steel types are in play, so similar to Retro Cup, there is room for Dragon and Ice types to thrive. Happy holidays and happy studying!]]>

			<title>Ultra League Top Performers Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Ultra League top performers have been updated with early training battle results. Poliwrath is the biggest topic of the new Ultra League, and it's having all of its expected success as an individual performer and on teams. Fire and Water are duking it out among top Pokemon, while Ultra League staples like Giratina and Cresselia continue to remain strong option. More data to come later in the season!]]>

			<title>Cetitan Rankings, Battle Logic Tweaks</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Cetoddle and Cetitan debut soon! These pure Ice types are comparable to Avalugg with high HP instead of Defense, and an overall lower stat product. They're unlikely to see competitive use but are plenty playable and worth holding onto for the future.<br><br>In the latest update, I've also tweaked the simulations to address Skarmory's move usage, particularly Brave Bird against bulky targets like Toxapex or Giratina. Skarmory will now prefer Sky Attack against these opponents, slightly improving its matchups and rankings.]]>

			<title>Retro Cup Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted top performers from a small sample of Retro Cup training battles and updated the Retro Cup rankings with weightings based on the past week of usage. Top performing teams include fewer Dragons and double-Dragons than I was expecting, and instead highlight Lanturn, Froslass, Jellicent, and bulky Normal types as potential team-building glue. Your mileage may vary.<br><br>High Lanturn, Altaria, and Froslass usage shed light on anti-meta opportunities in the rankings, including Pokemon like Abomasnow or Trevenant. Dragon types will continue to reign supreme in Retro Cup thanks to the absence of resistances, so choose your dragons wisely. Enjoy your battles!]]>

			<title>Great League Rankings Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the Great League rankings with new weightings based on Pokemon usage in the first week of GO Battle League and usage in the Stuttgart Regional Tournament. This update places more emphasis on matchups against Pokemon like Lanturn, Azumarill, Skarmory, and Talonflame, and factors in a reduced usage of Grass and Dark types. As always, the rankings are just a starting point and a guideline for exploring the meta. Happy studying!]]>

			<title>Little Holiday Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Holiday Cup will be going fun sized in the Little Cup later this month. At the time of writing, Little Holiday Cup allows all Normal, Grass, Electric, Flying, Ghost, and Ice-type Pokemon at 500 CP or under. With no explicit bans, this would include Smeargle, which has yet to be eligible in a Little Cup format. Smeargle boasts a strong set of potential moves including Lock-On, Incinerate, Flying Press, V-Create, Sacred Sword, and more. This combined with its stat product should make it the dominant Pokemon if it is indeed allowed.<br><br>Beyond Smeargle, several Great League Pokemon such as Vigoroth and Alolan Marowak should make the jump to compete with Little Cup staples like Ducklett, Vulpix, Cottonee, and Litwick. Check out the rankings for more details!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Training Analysis has been updated with an early look at the Great League meta! The meta is still developing, and so far some of the obvious suspects top the charts including Lanturn and Skarmory. Talonflame neither overperformed nor underperformed, perhaps thanks to a surge in Lanturn and a developing Dragon anti-meta.<br><br>One big surprise is a plummet in both Sableye usage and performance. Its key target, Medicham, has been nerfed this season, coupled with a buff to Azumarill has spelled trouble for Sableye in the early goings.<br><br>Thanks for your hard practice and good luck through the start of the season!]]>

			<title>Holiday Cup Rankings Added</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings for the Great League Holiday Cup are now available! Vigoroth should prove to be even more dominant than before, and Talonflame, Lanturn, and Skarmory will continue their Great League tango here. Some new picks also enter the mix including Skeledirge, Charjabug, and Arctibax to serve as potential corebreakers. Study up before the weather outside gets frightful and stay tuned for Little Holiday Cup rankings next week!]]>

			<title>Retro Cup Training Added</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Retro Cup training is now available to practice your teams! In addition, I've updated Great League training teams from early usage so far this season. Keep an eye out for a top performers update later next week breaking down the best performing Pokemon and teams in training so far. Good luck!]]>

			<title>Site Updated for Season of Timeless Travels!</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The website is updated with the move changes for Season of Timeless Travels! Rankings, battle simulations, and the team builder now include the latest changes for this season. Retro Cup rankings are also now available, and Holiday Cup rankings will be coming shortly. You can expect a top performer update on the Training Analysis page after the first week of the season.<br><br>For this season, I've included two entries for Lanturn in the Great League rankingsâ€”one with Spark and one with Water Gun. Lanturn is the only Pokemon to be featured this way given its importance in the metagame, but I'll be considering how to expand this for the future.<br><br>Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Added Hisuian Starters</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Hisuian starter Pokemon are now available on the site, with Hisuian Samurott making its debut this Sunday! Note that these Pokemon do not have their Community Day exclusive moves available via Elite TM at this time. Hisuian Samurott will need to wait for Hydro Cannon to see much viability, and even then it's unlikely to surpass Greninja.<br><br>With this update, I've also fixed an issue where navigating directly to Multi-Battle would show results against all Pokemon instead of just the meta Pokemon.]]>

Some of these values are speculative since energy values won't be known until the season begins on Friday. A full site update will come then!]]>
