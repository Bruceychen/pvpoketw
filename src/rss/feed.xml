			<title>Appletun and Flapple Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Appletun and Flapple debut as Grass/Dragon types with differing stats and movesets. Neither is competitive in their current state (they're comparable to Alolan Exeggutor), but Appletun has the most potential. It packs decent stat product with room to improve its movepool with attacks like Dragon Tail, Sucker Punch, Trailblaze, and an eventual signature move.<br><br>Applin also has unreleased alternative evolutions, Dipplin and Hydrapple. Hold onto them in case of future updates!]]>

			<title>Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Great League Remix returns next month, this time banning the 20 most used Pokemon from the current season. The bans include staples like Azumarill and Clodsire, plus newcomers like Cradily and Lapras.<br><br>Remix should shape up to be a wide open meta with a deep roster of remaining Pokemon. Among them are Great League powerhouses like Claydol, Diggersby, and Galarian Corsola. Some strong but underused Pokemon should also come to the forefront, such as Jellicent and Grumpig.<br><br>As usual for Great League Remix, Ghost and Dragon appear to be strong offensive types with the top Dark, Steel, and Fairy options banned. Galarian Corsola, Dusclops, and Dusknoir may be able to take advantage of this, but watch for Furret, Guzzlord, Umbreon, and others to step up. Meanwhile, Dragons might be more limited here than in past remixes since there are several strong Steel options present.<br><br>The most notable of these is Tinkaton, which only recently debuted. Not only does it pack Steel typing, it's likely to fill Azumarill's spot as the dominant Fairy. Its biggest challenge is accessibility, so time will tell if there are enough Tinkaton in circulation to truly shape the meta.]]>

			<title>Tinkaton Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Tinkaton makes its debut with smashing potential for PvP! As a bulky Fairy/Steel type, it packs a whopping 11 resistances. Its Charged Attack options are underwhelming, but Fairy Wind lets it make the most of them. Altogether, Tinkaton should see immediate play in Great League and become a contender in Ultra League as well.<br><br>Tinkaton's Charged Attack options include Play Rough, Heavy Slam, Flash Cannon, and Bulldoze. Play Rough is a clear choice, balancing energy and power. Steel is a limited offensive typing, so neither Heavy Slam nor Flash Cannon are immediately obvious choices. Between the two, Heavy Slam is much more accessible at 50 energy. Bulldoze is Tinkaton's weakest attack, but may have some play. It provides meager coverage against Fire, Poison and other Steel types (such as the mirror matchup), and some trainers might like its chaotic debuff potential. Bulldoze is also Tinkaton's lowest energy attack at 45 energy.<br><br>Note that Tinkaton will be exclusive to 7km eggs and paid Timed Research encounters during its debut event. It will be available in 10km eggs after the event.]]>

			<title>Eldegoss and Upper Hand Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Eldegoss has debuted in Pokemon GO. It's a pure Grass type with decent bulk, but its pure Grass movepool limits its potential for now.<br><br>Heracross, Hariyama, and Scraggy are receiving the new attack Upper Hand in a raid day this weekend. None of these Pokemon are currently viable, but Upper Hand looks like convincing option even with attacks like Close Combat and Superpower in the mix. Upper Hand clocks in at 40 energy and has a 30% chance to reduce the target's Defense by one stage. This makes it one of the fastest moves for these Pokemon, and it has great damage output without a self-inflicted debuff. Both Heracross and Hariyama would need a lot of help in the future to become meta relevant, but something to keep an eye on for the future.]]>

			<title>Spring Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Spring Cup arrives next week, featuring Water, Grass, and Poison types. This rotation includes bans to Jumpluff, Roserade, and Toxapex. These bans plus drastic move updates should help this Spring Cup turn over a new leaf. Since the typings are limited, still anticipate a narrow meta.<br><br>Ferrothorn, Lapras, and Galarian Weezing are three standout Pokemon that may form the core meta. They have few corebreakers between them. Golisopod and Araquanid help break things up, but must watch for Cradily, which has seen rising play in Open Great League. There are other Steel options to keep an eye on, such as Empoleon, Mawile with your choice of Fire Fang or Astonish, or the regional Klefki. However, note that Tinkaton will debut in the second half of the rotation.]]>

			<title>Paldean Tauros Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Regional forms of Tauros will be debuting in raids. Each is a Fighting type with below average stat product but interesting moves, including Double Kick and Trailblaze. Blaze Breed and Aqua Breed Tauros can be found in the Eastern and Western hemispheres respectively, while Combat Breed Tauros is exclusive to the Iberian Peninsula.<br><br>Overall, the Paldean Tauros forms have middling PvP performance with some themed cup potential. Aqua Breed Tauros has the most potential as a spammy alternative to Poliwrath with the newly buffed Aqua Jet. The Combat and Blaze forms are usable but don't compare to stronger Fighting types.]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the Great League top performers with training analysis from the season so far! The meta is still changing, especially in the wake of new Play! Pokemon tournament results, so keep an eye out for new meta shakers in GO Battle League.<br><br>So far, top individual performers include Dazzling Gleam Sableye, Cradily, and Lapras. Both Cradily and Lapras have found their way onto a number of top performing teams as well, commonly paired with Annihilape checks like Clodsire, Talonflame, Skeledirge, or Grumpig. Speaking of Clodsire, it's a member of the old guard that's still holding on in this new meta and featured on many top teams. It's a strong check to Morpeko's swarming presence, although it's facing rising competition from Claydol for its role. Claydol recently saw notable success in the Stockholm regional tournament running Rock Tomb + Ice Beam.]]>

			<title>Master Premier Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Master Premier returns in a few weeks, and its top meta Pokemon received some love in the recent move update. Most notably, Florges now packs Attack-boosting Grass coverage in Trailblaze. Some trainers previously opted for Petal Blizzard for the same coverage, but Trailblaze is a clear upgrade that elevates this top meta Pokemon to even stronger levels. Meanwhile, Golisopod should have a larger role in the core meta with the changes to Aqua Jet. Not to be overlooked, Hex Gholdengo is back as one of the best closers in the format.<br><br>Pokemon that may be vital tools against the top meta include Metagross and Skeledirge. Skeledirge entirely walls Florges, and Torch Song now provides momentum that it can carry over into the next matchup. Some may still opt for Disarming Voice given the presence of Dragons.]]>

			<title>Bug Fixes and UI Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've made a few updates and fixes to the website including the following:<br><br>- Pokemon group selection and Matrix Battle results now display the Pokemon in a numbered list. This should help identify Pokemon among a large group of similar ones.<br><br>- The "@legacy" search term no longer includes Pokemon that know Frustration or Return.<br><br>- Fixed an issue where the "Performance" radar chart would appear in error on ranking subcategory pages where that data isn't available.<br><br>- Fixed a minor sim issue where Pokemon would sometimes throw an inefficient Charged Attack right before fainting.]]>

			<title>Skeledirge Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fuecoco has a big Community Day this weekend, where Skeledirge will be receiving Blast Burn as an exclusive move and Torch Song as a regular addition to its movepool. Blast Burn is the Fire-type nuke we all know, while Torch Song is an Attack-boosting move that's slightly stronger Flame Charge, dealing more damage and costing less energy. Skeledirge is a top Fire type in Great League and Ultra League, and should see renewed play with its new moveset options. It also has some niche play in Master Premier, so look to evolve one for each league.<br><br>Skeledirge now has multiple viable moveset options. It previously ran Disarming Voice + Shadow Ball as its preferred Charged Attacks. Fairy + Ghost provide near perfect coverage, able to hit any Pokemon in the metagame for neutral damage. Some may continue to opt for this moveset depending on the meta, however Torch Song or Blast Burn now provide greater damage output and a higher performance ceiling.<br><br>At an initial glance, the STAB combination of Torch Song + Shadow Ball appears to be the most likely moveset going forward. It still provides a wide degree of coverage (walled only by Guzzlord in the meta), and Torch Song boosts Skeledirge's performance to higher levels! For example, boosted Torch Song is about as strong as super effective Disarming Voice, and boosted Shadow Ball is about as strong as unboosted Blast Burn. This moveset only sees drawbacks in metas with heavy a Dragon-type presence where there's a two-stage difference in effectiveness between Disarming Voice and Torch Song.<br><br>Blast Burn is Skeledirge's strongest attack. However, Torch Song + Blast Burn leaves it with no coverage. Sometimes even resisted Blast Burn is better than neutral attacks on other Pokemon, but STAB Shadow Ball is strong enough that Blast Burn isn't the de facto attack on Skeledirge. Blast Burn has slightly faster pacing than Shadow Ball and can be doubled up, so there are some advantages to running it.<br><br>Even if you don't plan to use Blast Burn, look to evolve multiple Skeledirge so you have the option. This is a big Community Day for PvP, so have fun and good luck!]]>

			<title>Scroll Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Scroll Cup takes place next week, featuring the three types in the Kubfu family - Dark, Fighting, and Water. You won't have to scroll far to find your Pokemon for this cup because it's a pretty limited meta. Great League standouts like Azumarill, Mandibuzz, and Annihilape will be taking on vital counterpicks like Chesnaught, Lanturn, and Jellicent. Dark-type attacks are resisted by two of the featured types, so Mandibuzz and others may lean toward alternate movesets that provide more neutral play.]]>

			<title>Might and Mastery Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site is updated for the Season of Might and Mastery! Willpower Cup rankings are now available, and Scroll Cup rankings are coming soon.<br><br>This season brings a ton of move updates and will certainly shake up the meta. Some of the biggest winners include Lapras, Grumpig, and Claydol with major buffs or attack updates. As a previous meta staple, Lapras likely has the longest staying power and looks to overthrow Dewgong and Feraligatr in similar roles. Meanwhile, Galarian Corsola is no longer the sole and supreme Ghost-type. Multiple Ghosts including Sableye, Jellicent, Dusclops, and Dusknoir received updates which can push them into the metagame.<br><br>There's a lot to take in, so have fun in the early season! Stay tuned for more updates on upcoming cups and tournament results.]]>
