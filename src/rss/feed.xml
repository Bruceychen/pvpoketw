			<title>New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[New Shadows are debuting, including Shadow Cresselia! The Shadow version sacrifices its signature bulk for extra attack power. While Cresselia isn't the best Pokemon to take advantage of the Shadow boost, its Shadow version is still strong and worth using if you don't have access to regular Cresselia. Stay tuned for the World Championship event where you will be able to catch a regular Cresselia in special research as well!]]>

			<title>Fossil Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fossil Cup returns next week, and looks to center around Poliwrath and Ferrothorn. These two face few corebreakers except for Quaquaval, who could see anti-meta play. Electric types like Lanturn and Magnezone should also prove crucial if they can avoid Grass. We'll have this cup for two weeks so there will be plenty of time to dig up the meta!]]>

			<title>Great and Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated training analysis for Great and Ultra League with the past few weeks of data. In Great League, things look relatively stable although note that some Remix practice may impact this dataset. Water Gun Lanturn and Quagsire are still proving to be top options, while top teams are trending more toward Fast Attack pressure with the likes of Wigglytuff, Victreebel, Bastiodon, and Dragonair.]]>

			<title>Eelektross Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Tynamo Community Day is this weekend, and Eelektross will receive the Fast Attack Volt Switch. Eelektross is best with Volt Switch, but unfortunately won't be meta relevant over other Electric picks like Charjabug, Lanturn, or Magnezone. Catch a few just in case!]]>

			<title>Master League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Master League top performers have been updated with results from the site's training battles so far this season. Both Dawn Wings and Dusk Mane Necrozma have put on impressive debuts, topping the individual and team lists. Now that both are globally available, we may see Master League go through some upheaval to adjust, including a clearer role for Yveltal.<br><br>]]>

			<title>Custom Group Transformations</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[When you work with custom groups in Multi-Battle or Matrix Battle, the "IVs" options have now been reworked to apply the selected option to the whole group. This includes a "best buddy" option to set all members of a group to level 51 for Master League.]]>

			<title>Fantasy Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fantasy Cup (Great League Edition) returns in a few weeks for Dragon, Fairy, and Steel types to clash. This format has few changes from its run earlier this year, so teams from January should work just as well now. <br><br>Steel Wing and Shadow Empoleon are the biggest additions, resisting all moves from Azumarill and putting up a fight against Dragons and Galarian Stunfisk. Tapu Fini now has Nature's Madness as well, closing the gap between it and Azumarill and making ABB teams with both more potent. Lastly, Thunder Punch is arguably a better coverage move for Lucario than Blaze Kick, but both are viable options.]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The first training analysis of the season highlights Water Gun Lanturn, Quagsire, and Goodra as new elements to the meta. While this season doesn't have too many changes, some familiar faces are bringing new tricks. Fire types like Skeledirge and Typhlosion are also standing surprisingly strong against the Water types, and old favorites like Umbreon and Sableye appear to have a chance for a comeback.<br><br>Among the top performing teams, a Normal type such as Lickitung or Vigoroth seems to be the common glue holding these teams together. Both Pokemon are flexible and favor neutral play. At the same time, Fast Attack pressure teams with Bastiodon, Victreebel, Wigglytuff, Dragonair, and similar picks are also standing the test of time against the early season. Best of luck the rest of the week!]]>

			<title>Great League Ranking Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[With NAIC behind us, I've brushed up the Great League rankings and meta group based on early usage so far. I've also adjusted a few recommended movesetsâ€”Cresselia is now back to Moonblast and Talonflame features a double Flying moveset that has been prominent in tournament play. As always, the rankings are just a starting point. Good luck in your upcoming battles!]]>

			<title>Custom Ranking Fixes</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the custom rankings tool with some fixes and features that significantly speed up the time it takes to generate results. Under the "Advanced" settings, there's a new option that excludes low-performing Pokemon (Pokemon which have an overall score of less than 70 in the open league rankings). Depending on the cup, this can reduce the number of simulations required by up to half. The tool is much faster in general now, especially for "open" style formats.]]>

			<title>Goodra Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Goodra is getting Thunder Punch for its Community Day, expanding its coverage options. In terms of overall performance, Thunder Punch appears on par with Power Whip or Draco Meteor for Great League, while it has fewer targets in Ultra League. Which moveset you choose may depend on your team and personal preferences. Make sure to grab Thunder Punch Goodra this weekend just in case!]]>

			<title>Next Season Preview</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Next season's PvP updates have been revealed, and the site is now updated with preview rankings which include the changes. Most notably, Spark and Scald nerfs should dial back Lanturn and Whiscash in Great League. The move updates don't have much immediate impact alone, but these small but important changes could open the door for meta shifts as teams adjust.<br><br>Note that next season's move updates will go live on June 3rd, after the weekend's Play! Pokemon events.]]>

			<title>Site Update 1.31.9</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site has been updated with a few new features and fixes:<br><br>- In single battles, you can select "1 turn switch" under a Pokemon's options to simulate the battle with 1 turn of delay for that Pokemon. The optimal move timing guide also reflects the 1 turn delay.<br>- Matchup differences in Matrix Battle are now color coded with the gradient to reflect which differences are hard wins, soft wins, etc.<br>- Fixed an issue where battle time was being calculated incorrectly for mirror matchups.]]>

			<title>New Ultra Beast Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Three new Ultra Beasts are coming, including Stakataka, Blacephalon, and Naganadel, which can evolve from Poipole. Unfortunately, none of them are noteworthy for PvP at this time. Blacephalon and Naganadel suffer from incredibly low stat product while Stakataka doesn't have the moves to stand out. Keep a lookout for more Ultra Beasts in the future!]]>
