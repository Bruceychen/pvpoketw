			<title>Catch Cup Rankings, Great League Giratina</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted rankings for Great League Catch Cup as well as updated the Little Catch Cup rankings. Both of these use weightings based on usage data to help inform the scoring. Thanks, GO Battle Log!<br><br>In addition, a few legendaries have been introduced to Great League with the latest timed research, including Giratina's Origin forme. It isn't a meta-altering monster like its cousin, but it's still a strong corebreaker with anti-meta potential with resistances to Counter and elemental types. It will require trading to obtain, so make good use of your special trades at meetups and events!]]>

			<title>Little Catch Cup Rankings Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Catch Cup is live, and Little Catch Cup appears to allow all Pokemon at 500 CP or below - including Shuckle and Smeargle. I've updated the rankings with all Pokemon, though note some Pokemon may not be obtainable such as certain Shadows or Legendaries. More so than ever, Little Catch Cup will emphasize which trainers are willing to invest significant resources into the cup's top picks. It's an opportunity to flaunt some fun catches if you have them, but otherwise, regular Catch Cup is still available.]]>

			<title>Dialga Origin and Palkia Origin Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Origin formes of Dialga and Palkia are debuting this weekend! Which should you prioritize for Master League?<br><br>Dialga has long been the meta defining Pokemon for Master League. Its Origin forme has a tradeoff in stats, slightly lower Attack but decently higher Defense and overall more stat product. In addition, Origin Dialga boasts Roar of Time, which is identical to Draco Meteor without the Attack debuff. Altogether, Origin Dialga is a slight improvement over Master League's biggest menace. The head to head matchup is about dead even. The biggest knock against Origin Dialga is that it loses Charged Move ties against its counterpart.<br><br>Palkia isn't meta defining like Dialga, however Origin Palkia is a significant upgrade over regular Palkia. It has both higher Attack and Defense stats, and while Spacial Rend doesn't hit as hard as Draco Meteor, it's a more flexible and accessible nuke. Palkia itself has significant opportunity in the current Master League meta where Landorus, Kyogre, and Ho-oh are popular picks, so its Origin forme should come out swinging.<br><br>If you have already built a Dialga, I recommend focusing on Origin Palkia since it's a more significant upgrade and it will add more depth to your Master League roster. If by chance you haven't built a Dialga yet, I would dedicate your efforts there so you can field Master League's most central Pokemon.]]>

			<title>Enamorus Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Enamorus has finally received stats and moves, and it looks like an aggressive pick in Master League and even Ultra League. This Fairy/Flying type is a glass cannon, but got access to Fairy Wind and Fly for rapid attacks. Its secondary moves include Dazzling Gleam (underwhelming but necessary to hit Dialga) and Grass Knot. Some might find Togekiss to be more reliable, but with that said, Enamorus brings more depth to Master League's Fairy roster and an energy oriented playstyle.]]>

			<title>Little Catch Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted baseline Little Cup rankings to help with initial team building for next week. I'll update these rankings after the cup goes live to weigh them against the most used Pokemon, so expect them to change. (Bronzor is unlikely to move anywhere, however!) I plan to post separate Great League Catch Cup rankings as well, but I'll need to wait after the cup begins so they can factor in which Pokemon players are using most. In the meantime you can use the Great League rankings and ignore Pokemon that aren't available to you. Good luck in your preparations!]]>

			<title>Ultra League Top Performers Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Happy GO Battle Weekend! I've updated the Ultra League top performers with the past few weeks of training data. Annihilape has made a strong debut, placing in the top individual performers and featured on several top teams. Jellicent is seeing a resurgence alongside it, both as a partner and a counter. Check out the list if you need Pokemon or team ideas, and have fun battling!]]>

			<title>Hisuian Decidueye Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisuian Decidueye has some interesting pieces, but it's missing just enough to be truly viable. It's a downgrade compared to Chesnaught, lacking both Frenzy Plant and a more desirable Fighting-type attack. Hisuian Decidueye could see play in a future Fighting Cup where Psycho Cut and Aerial Ace give it a leg up on the competition.]]>

			<title>Great League and Hisui Cup Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers with the past week of Great League and Hisui Cup training! In Great League, the meta has continued to establish around Skarmory + Whiscash, and Dewgong tops the individual performers as a result. Dragonair remains a strong player on top teams, most frequently as a neutral lead with a lead-dependent pair in the back, such as Lanturn and Skarmory.<br><br>In Hisui Cup, the meta is focused around a small group including Empoleon, Grastrodon, Drifblim, Toxicroak, and Froslass. Empoleon features on just about all of the top performing teams, most commonly with Froslass or Drifblim as partners. Good luck in the next week of battles!]]>

			<title>Drampa Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Drampa debuts during the Lunar New Year event in raids and field research. Its Normal/Dragon typing gives it unique matchups against Pokemon like Lickitung and Lanturn, but unfortunately its stats and moves are too lacking to make it anything more than spice. Drampa won't be leading the charge, but let the Year of the Dragon commence!]]>

			<title>Evolution Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Vigoroth is the theme of this season's themed cups, and it's back and better than ever in Evolution Cup. Primeape now joins the fray to keep Vigoroth in check, and Charjabug with Volt Switch should also be a key player. Evolution Cup lacks Steel and Fairy options, so expect Dragon types to run rampant in the early meta. Togetic and Metang may prove to be vital anti-meta picks to answer them! This is still Vigoroth's cup through and through, so I'd recommend it as a starting point for any meta or anti-meta team building.]]>

			<title>Hisui Cup Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated Hisui Cup resources to match the rule description on the Pokemon GO blog. The blog previously stated that Hisui Cup would include all Pokemon in the Pokemon Legends: Arceus Pokedex, but this information turned out to be incorrect and these Pokemon aren't eligible for Hisui Cup. Thanks for the patience on these updates!<br><br>Hisui Cup training is also now available with preset teams based on early usage data. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the Great League top performers with the past week of training data including Annihilape. This highly anticipated Pokemon has taken a strong, early position in the meta is already featured on both the top individual and team lists. It seems to fit a wide variety of teams, although it's commonly paired with a Steel type like Skarmory or Bastiodon which can cover its weaknesses to Fairy or Flying.<br><br>As the meta adjusts, other top performing Pokemon include Trevenant, Gligar, Charjabug, and Cresselia who could have opportunities. Each does well against Annihilape and a meta that is still oriented around Lanturn and other Water types. Good luck in the next week of battles and hopefully this list can provide inspiration!]]>

			<title>Sandsear Storm Landorus and Grassroot Tournament Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Therian Landorus has arrived with its signature move, Sandsear Storm, and it's a major upgrade for Master League! Sandsear Storm may not be as strong as Superpower, but it makes Landorus more consistent and gives it much needed artificial bulk. Sandsear Storm + Stone Edge provides coveted Ground + Rock coverage, enabling Landorus to hit targets like Solgaleo and Metagross more effectively than before. If you're a Master League enthusiast, this is one you don't want to miss!<br><br>Catching up on the tournament side, I have updated data posted for all of the Battle Frontier formats and Devon Corp's new Sovereign Cup. Thanks for your patience on these and thanks to the respective teams for helping put these together!]]>

			<title>Revavroom and New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The upcoming Rocket event features Revavroom's debut alongside multiple new Shadows. Revavroom is underwhelming, but several new Shadows will be great pick-ups for future themed cups, including Hisui Cup!<br><br>Toxicroak is the latest Shadow Counter user and is generally an upgrade, with its heavy Fast Attack pressure, an accessible Charged Attack in Mud Bomb, and new coverage from Shadow Ball. Froslass is comparable to Venusaur in both power and pacing, and is also worth having on hand as a PvP staple. Other notable picks include Empoleon and Crustle, both of which sport strong Fast Attack pressure and have themed cup potential. Have fun and don't forget to remove Frustration!]]>

			<title>Annihilape Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Annihilape has debuted in Pokemon GO with just about all the moves it could hope for! While it will have to wait for its signature move, Rage Fist, Annihilape arrives with significant PvP potential. It's viable in all three leagues, having the most play in Great and Ultra League. The key ingredient for Annihilape's success is its Ghost/Fighting typing, which gives it superiority over most other Counter users, especially Vigoroth and Medicham. Offensively, it has access to Counter and Shadow Ball, plus Ice Punch, Night Slash, or Close Combat.<br><br>There are no type combinations which resist all of Fighting, Ice, and Ghost, making Annihilape a strong generalist with few true walls. However, it does lack stat product and pacing, so it shouldn't prove as dominant as Medicham was in its heyday. Buddy up with your Primeape and good luck battling!]]>

			<title>Hisui Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisui Cup returns for the Season of Timeless Travels, but this time it includes the full Pokemon Legends: Arceus Pokedex! This adds a wealth of new picks on top of those from the Sinnoh region, including Lickitung, Gligar, Umbreon, Whiscash, and Walrein.<br><br>Compared to Sinnoh Cup, Whiscash should replace Gastrodon as the top "mudboy" and Lucario may see significantly less play with the inclusion of Shadow Machamp. Sparse Electric and Grass options could make Water types like Mantine and Whiscash fairly safe, and even with strong Ground types in the mix, don't count Bastiodon out of the running. Cresselia should play a key role in protecting it. Good luck preparing and battling!]]>
