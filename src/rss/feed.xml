			<title>Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[This season's Great League Remix bans several of the league's most infamous Pokemon, while others such as Gligar and Annihilape slip through the cracks. Similar to previous Remixes, Dragon, Dark, and Ice-type Pokemon stand to gain from banning the strongest Steels and Fairies. Empoleon, Steelix, Carbink, and Alolan Ninetales look ready to step up to the plate but face their fair share of challenges as well.<br><br>One of the biggest questions is which Electric types will fill the gap left by Lanturn and Charjabug? Magnezone has seen recent tournament success while Dedenne could potentially thrive in an anti-meta role thanks to its Fairy typing. Good luck preparing!]]>

			<title>Master Premier and Tapu Bulu Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are now available for Master Premier Cup, which returns in a few weeks! It will feature several Pokemon new to the format, including Annihilape, Feraligatr, Skeledirge, and Golisopod. While Dragonite, Gyarados, and Fairies should continue to define the meta, these new picks will look at add some twists and corebreakers. Good luck preparing!<br><br>In regular Master League, Tapu Bulu is debuting with its exclusive move, Nature's Madness. Tapu Bulu has higher stat product compared to some of its companions, and its typing gives it a potential niche against both Dragon types and Kyogre. Unfortunately, its struggles against Dialga and Ho-oh may limit it in the current meta.]]>

			<title>Great and Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Great and Ultra League top performers are now updated with training data from the season so far. In the Great League, Dragon types continue to be a dominant theme with Dragonair and Altaria taking the lead. In Ultra League, Feraligatr safe swap has proven to be the superior formula, often combined with Skeledirge or Talonflame in the back. Take a look for more Pokemon and team ideas!]]>

			<title>New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A batch of new Shadow Pokemon debut next week, including Shadow Groudon and Shadow Pidgeot! Groudon appears to be a slight downgrade as Precipice Blades hits hard but isn't quite as fast as Shadow Groudon would like. Not to mention, Groudon bows to the current top Ground type, Landorus!<br><br>Pidgeot is one of the sims' favorite heroes, and Shadow Pidgeot provides interesting new dynamics for this baiting bird. It seems to perform better with Aerial Ace over Feather Dance; lower bulk reduces the effectiveness of Feather Dance's Attack drops, and if you want to hit harder, you may as well hit harder! On the whole, Shadow Pidgeot is a sidegrade to the original and may work better depending on your playstyle.]]>

			<title>Ultra Premier Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Ultra Premier makes its long-awaited return in a few weeks! Old contenders like Empoleon and Gallade have new life, while new contenders like Feraligatr and Annihilape will add major twists to this fan favorite meta.<br><br>Without Giratina or Cresselia in the mix, Poliwrath becomes a major target. Look for Grass and Electric Pokemon like Venusaur, Ampharos, Galvantula, or Lanturn to keep it at bay. Electric in particular has anti-meta potential with the strong number of Water and Flying types available.<br><br>In the mix of them all, Dragon stands out as a defining type for the meta. Shadow Dragonite should remain the pick of choice while several underused options like Dragalge and Goodra could see increased play with the Aqua Tail buff. With Fairy and Steel options looking limited, double Dragon lines could come roaring back from the Ultra Premier of years past. Empoleon is not only one of the best Dragon partners, but also now one of the best Dragon counters with Steel Wing instead of Waterfall. Avoiding the aforementioned Poliwrath will be vital for its success. Good luck! ]]>

			<title>Master League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers for Master League have been updated with training data from the past month. Some of this data precedes the Aqua Tail buff, so Palkia may perform better than the numbers shown. Zygarde/Solgaleo appear to remain top contenders, but the Origin Formes of Dialga and Palkia have proven highly effective after their debut.<br><br>Spring Cup also continues this week, so be on the lookout for a top performers update there as well!]]>

			<title>Incineroar Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Incineroar is getting not one but two powerful attacks this weekend during Community Dayâ€”Blast Burn as an exclusive attack, and Darkest Lariat as a regular attack. Which do you want for your Incineroar? Maybe both!<br><br>Incineroar can generate energy quickly with either Snarl or Double Kick, and both Charged Attacks provide immense damage output. Blaze Kick can come in clutch, but Blast Burn isn't that much further to reach. Look to evolve multiple for each league if you want flexibility with your movesets.<br><br>Both attacks are major improvements for Incineroar, although it likely won't rise beyond a spice or themed cup pick with Water types drowning the open metas. Look to make the most of Incineroar in Ultra League, where its combats popular picks like Giratina and Cresselia. Enjoy your Community Day!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers have been updated with an initial look at training analysis for the new meta! Feraligatr is the biggest new kid on the block, and it's been chomping at the bit for a meaningful move update. With Shadow Claw, it's now well on its way to solidifying itself in the meta. Shadow and non-Shadow Feraligatr combine to be top 5 in usage, and their performances have been similar with Shadow slightly edging out non-Shadow. Ice Beam appears to be the secondary move of choice (not enough data was recorded for Crunch).<br><br>With the rise of Feraligatr, Mandibuzz and Guzzlord demonstrated potential thanks to their Shadow Claw resistance. Guzzlord has been an early favorite so far, also resisting Lanturn and Charjabug. Dragon types as a whole have performed well have made a mark on this early meta, with the majority of top teams featuring Dragon leads. The meta is young and there are many opportunities for it to adapt especially as the tournament scene develops.]]>

			<title>Catch Cup Rankings, Great League Giratina</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted rankings for Great League Catch Cup as well as updated the Little Catch Cup rankings. Both of these use weightings based on usage data to help inform the scoring. Thanks, GO Battle Log!<br><br>In addition, a few legendaries have been introduced to Great League with the latest timed research, including Giratina's Origin forme. It isn't a meta-altering monster like its cousin, but it's still a strong corebreaker with anti-meta potential with resistances to Counter and elemental types. It will require trading to obtain, so make good use of your special trades at meetups and events!]]>
