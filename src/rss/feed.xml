			<title>Enamorus Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Enamorus has finally received stats and moves, and it looks like an aggressive pick in Master League and even Ultra League. This Fairy/Flying type is a glass cannon, but got access to Fairy Wind and Fly for rapid attacks. Its secondary moves include Dazzling Gleam (underwhelming but necessary to hit Dialga) and Grass Knot. Some might find Togekiss to be more reliable, but with that said, Enamorus brings more depth to Master League's Fairy roster and an energy oriented playstyle.]]>

			<title>Little Catch Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted baseline Little Cup rankings to help with initial team building for next week. I'll update these rankings after the cup goes live to weigh them against the most used Pokemon, so expect them to change. (Bronzor is unlikely to move anywhere, however!) I plan to post separate Great League Catch Cup rankings as well, but I'll need to wait after the cup begins so they can factor in which Pokemon players are using most. In the meantime you can use the Great League rankings and ignore Pokemon that aren't available to you. Good luck in your preparations!]]>

			<title>Ultra League Top Performers Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Happy GO Battle Weekend! I've updated the Ultra League top performers with the past few weeks of training data. Annihilape has made a strong debut, placing in the top individual performers and featured on several top teams. Jellicent is seeing a resurgence alongside it, both as a partner and a counter. Check out the list if you need Pokemon or team ideas, and have fun battling!]]>

			<title>Hisuian Decidueye Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisuian Decidueye has some interesting pieces, but it's missing just enough to be truly viable. It's a downgrade compared to Chesnaught, lacking both Frenzy Plant and a more desirable Fighting-type attack. Hisuian Decidueye could see play in a future Fighting Cup where Psycho Cut and Aerial Ace give it a leg up on the competition.]]>

			<title>Great League and Hisui Cup Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers with the past week of Great League and Hisui Cup training! In Great League, the meta has continued to establish around Skarmory + Whiscash, and Dewgong tops the individual performers as a result. Dragonair remains a strong player on top teams, most frequently as a neutral lead with a lead-dependent pair in the back, such as Lanturn and Skarmory.<br><br>In Hisui Cup, the meta is focused around a small group including Empoleon, Grastrodon, Drifblim, Toxicroak, and Froslass. Empoleon features on just about all of the top performing teams, most commonly with Froslass or Drifblim as partners. Good luck in the next week of battles!]]>

			<title>Drampa Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Drampa debuts during the Lunar New Year event in raids and field research. Its Normal/Dragon typing gives it unique matchups against Pokemon like Lickitung and Lanturn, but unfortunately its stats and moves are too lacking to make it anything more than spice. Drampa won't be leading the charge, but let the Year of the Dragon commence!]]>

			<title>Evolution Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Vigoroth is the theme of this season's themed cups, and it's back and better than ever in Evolution Cup. Primeape now joins the fray to keep Vigoroth in check, and Charjabug with Volt Switch should also be a key player. Evolution Cup lacks Steel and Fairy options, so expect Dragon types to run rampant in the early meta. Togetic and Metang may prove to be vital anti-meta picks to answer them! This is still Vigoroth's cup through and through, so I'd recommend it as a starting point for any meta or anti-meta team building.]]>

			<title>Hisui Cup Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated Hisui Cup resources to match the rule description on the Pokemon GO blog. The blog previously stated that Hisui Cup would include all Pokemon in the Pokemon Legends: Arceus Pokedex, but this information turned out to be incorrect and these Pokemon aren't eligible for Hisui Cup. Thanks for the patience on these updates!<br><br>Hisui Cup training is also now available with preset teams based on early usage data. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated the Great League top performers with the past week of training data including Annihilape. This highly anticipated Pokemon has taken a strong, early position in the meta is already featured on both the top individual and team lists. It seems to fit a wide variety of teams, although it's commonly paired with a Steel type like Skarmory or Bastiodon which can cover its weaknesses to Fairy or Flying.<br><br>As the meta adjusts, other top performing Pokemon include Trevenant, Gligar, Charjabug, and Cresselia who could have opportunities. Each does well against Annihilape and a meta that is still oriented around Lanturn and other Water types. Good luck in the next week of battles and hopefully this list can provide inspiration!]]>

			<title>Sandsear Storm Landorus and Grassroot Tournament Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Therian Landorus has arrived with its signature move, Sandsear Storm, and it's a major upgrade for Master League! Sandsear Storm may not be as strong as Superpower, but it makes Landorus more consistent and gives it much needed artificial bulk. Sandsear Storm + Stone Edge provides coveted Ground + Rock coverage, enabling Landorus to hit targets like Solgaleo and Metagross more effectively than before. If you're a Master League enthusiast, this is one you don't want to miss!<br><br>Catching up on the tournament side, I have updated data posted for all of the Battle Frontier formats and Devon Corp's new Sovereign Cup. Thanks for your patience on these and thanks to the respective teams for helping put these together!]]>

			<title>Revavroom and New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The upcoming Rocket event features Revavroom's debut alongside multiple new Shadows. Revavroom is underwhelming, but several new Shadows will be great pick-ups for future themed cups, including Hisui Cup!<br><br>Toxicroak is the latest Shadow Counter user and is generally an upgrade, with its heavy Fast Attack pressure, an accessible Charged Attack in Mud Bomb, and new coverage from Shadow Ball. Froslass is comparable to Venusaur in both power and pacing, and is also worth having on hand as a PvP staple. Other notable picks include Empoleon and Crustle, both of which sport strong Fast Attack pressure and have themed cup potential. Have fun and don't forget to remove Frustration!]]>

			<title>Annihilape Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Annihilape has debuted in Pokemon GO with just about all the moves it could hope for! While it will have to wait for its signature move, Rage Fist, Annihilape arrives with significant PvP potential. It's viable in all three leagues, having the most play in Great and Ultra League. The key ingredient for Annihilape's success is its Ghost/Fighting typing, which gives it superiority over most other Counter users, especially Vigoroth and Medicham. Offensively, it has access to Counter and Shadow Ball, plus Ice Punch, Night Slash, or Close Combat.<br><br>There are no type combinations which resist all of Fighting, Ice, and Ghost, making Annihilape a strong generalist with few true walls. However, it does lack stat product and pacing, so it shouldn't prove as dominant as Medicham was in its heyday. Buddy up with your Primeape and good luck battling!]]>

			<title>Hisui Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisui Cup returns for the Season of Timeless Travels, but this time it includes the full Pokemon Legends: Arceus Pokedex! This adds a wealth of new picks on top of those from the Sinnoh region, including Lickitung, Gligar, Umbreon, Whiscash, and Walrein.<br><br>Compared to Sinnoh Cup, Whiscash should replace Gastrodon as the top "mudboy" and Lucario may see significantly less play with the inclusion of Shadow Machamp. Sparse Electric and Grass options could make Water types like Mantine and Whiscash fairly safe, and even with strong Ground types in the mix, don't count Bastiodon out of the running. Cresselia should play a key role in protecting it. Good luck preparing and battling!]]>

			<title>Hisuian Typhlosion Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisuian Typhlosion debuts during a raid day event this coming Sunday! It's a Fire/Ghost type like Skeledirge, with an interesting mix of Charged Attacks including Shadow Ball, Wild Charge, Overheat, and Fire Punch. Ultimately it falls short with Hex or Ember as its Fast Attack options, plus its significantly lower bulk. Even if it eventually gets Blast Burn, Hisuian Typhlosion will be waiting for a Fast Attack upgrade.]]>

			<title>Fantasy Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fantasy Cup returns in a few weeks, this time in Great League! This cup includes Dragon, Steel, and Fairy types with no bans. At first glance, Registeel + Azumarill and Galarian Stunfisk + Azumarill are the cores to look out for with few corebreakers between them. Overall, Fantasy Cup will likely be a concentrated meta which has an emphasis on mirror matchups. Prepare your sword and shield accordingly!]]>

			<title>Added Frenzy Plant Decidueye</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[During Community Day on January 6th, Decidueye will debut with the exclusive move, Frenzy Plant, alongside its signature move, Spirit Shackle. Frenzy Plant will be enough to make Decidueye playable, but it will generally fall behind Trevenant in viability. It does have some advantages with its Grass oriented attacks, which make it better against Normal types and bulky Water types.<br><br>Presently, Spirit Shackle has low enough power that resisted Frenzy Plants are still better. If Spirit Shackle remains as is, Brave Bird is likely to be preferred as the secondary move instead. Time permitting, I'll be looking to post a brief article for Decidueye Community Day soon!]]>
