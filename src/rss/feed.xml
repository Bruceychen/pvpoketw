			<title>Next Season Preview</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Next season's PvP updates have been revealed, and the site is now updated with preview rankings which include the changes. Most notably, Spark and Scald nerfs should dial back Lanturn and Whiscash in Great League. The move updates don't have much immediate impact alone, but these small but important changes could open the door for meta shifts as teams adjust.<br><br>Note that next season's move updates will go live on June 3rd, after the weekend's Play! Pokemon events.]]>

			<title>Site Update 1.31.9</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site has been updated with a few new features and fixes:<br><br>- In single battles, you can select "1 turn switch" under a Pokemon's options to simulate the battle with 1 turn of delay for that Pokemon. The optimal move timing guide also reflects the 1 turn delay.<br>- Matchup differences in Matrix Battle are now color coded with the gradient to reflect which differences are hard wins, soft wins, etc.<br>- Fixed an issue where battle time was being calculated incorrectly for mirror matchups.]]>

			<title>New Ultra Beast Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Three new Ultra Beasts are coming, including Stakataka, Blacephalon, and Naganadel, which can evolve from Poipole. Unfortunately, none of them are noteworthy for PvP at this time. Blacephalon and Naganadel suffer from incredibly low stat product while Stakataka doesn't have the moves to stand out. Keep a lookout for more Ultra Beasts in the future!]]>

			<title>Catch Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are now available for Catch Cup (Great League Edition). These rankings implement usage data from the first few days to highlight which Pokemon may have an advantage in the current meta. For example, Carbink has strong matchups against popular Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mantine, Skeledirge, and Charjabug. As always, Catch Cup is restricted to the best Pokemon available to you, so your mileage may vary. Good luck the rest of the season!]]>

			<title>Tsareena Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[It's Bounsweet Community Day this weekend, and Tsareena will receive a new move, High Jump Kick. This Fighting-type nuke has a 10% chance to lower your Defense by 4 stages, so it comes with a big risk. Tsareena seems to be best with Triple Axel and High Jump Kick. However, it struggles to stand out among stronger Grass types like Abomasnow or Chesnaught, who benefit from STAB. I'd recommend obtaining High Jump Kick Tsareena just in case!]]>

			<title>Tapu Fini Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Tapu Fini is the last to receive Nature's Madness, and it's a notable buff for the Water/Fairy Pokemon! Nature's Madness isn't as powerful as Moonblast, but the lower energy cost and the guaranteed Defense drop make Tapu Fini more flexible and dynamic. It's worth grabbing Tapu Fini if you don't have one already, and Nature's Madness is worthy of an Elite TM.]]>

			<title>Rankings Performance Comparison</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've added a small new feature that lets you compare the "Performance" details of two Pokemon in the rankings. Click the "Compare" button to select a Pokemon, and then you'll be able to compare their performance charts and numbers for each ranking category. You can use this to compare two similar Pokemon or two forms (such as Shadow vs non-Shadow).]]>

			<title>Great League Remix Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[This season's Great League Remix bans several of the league's most infamous Pokemon, while others such as Gligar and Annihilape slip through the cracks. Similar to previous Remixes, Dragon, Dark, and Ice-type Pokemon stand to gain from banning the strongest Steels and Fairies. Empoleon, Steelix, Carbink, and Alolan Ninetales look ready to step up to the plate but face their fair share of challenges as well.<br><br>One of the biggest questions is which Electric types will fill the gap left by Lanturn and Charjabug? Magnezone has seen recent tournament success while Dedenne could potentially thrive in an anti-meta role thanks to its Fairy typing. Good luck preparing!]]>

			<title>Master Premier and Tapu Bulu Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are now available for Master Premier Cup, which returns in a few weeks! It will feature several Pokemon new to the format, including Annihilape, Feraligatr, Skeledirge, and Golisopod. While Dragonite, Gyarados, and Fairies should continue to define the meta, these new picks will look at add some twists and corebreakers. Good luck preparing!<br><br>In regular Master League, Tapu Bulu is debuting with its exclusive move, Nature's Madness. Tapu Bulu has higher stat product compared to some of its companions, and its typing gives it a potential niche against both Dragon types and Kyogre. Unfortunately, its struggles against Dialga and Ho-oh may limit it in the current meta.]]>

			<title>Great and Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Great and Ultra League top performers are now updated with training data from the season so far. In the Great League, Dragon types continue to be a dominant theme with Dragonair and Altaria taking the lead. In Ultra League, Feraligatr safe swap has proven to be the superior formula, often combined with Skeledirge or Talonflame in the back. Take a look for more Pokemon and team ideas!]]>

			<title>New Shadow Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A batch of new Shadow Pokemon debut next week, including Shadow Groudon and Shadow Pidgeot! Groudon appears to be a slight downgrade as Precipice Blades hits hard but isn't quite as fast as Shadow Groudon would like. Not to mention, Groudon bows to the current top Ground type, Landorus!<br><br>Pidgeot is one of the sims' favorite heroes, and Shadow Pidgeot provides interesting new dynamics for this baiting bird. It seems to perform better with Aerial Ace over Feather Dance; lower bulk reduces the effectiveness of Feather Dance's Attack drops, and if you want to hit harder, you may as well hit harder! On the whole, Shadow Pidgeot is a sidegrade to the original and may work better depending on your playstyle.]]>

			<title>Ultra Premier Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Ultra Premier makes its long-awaited return in a few weeks! Old contenders like Empoleon and Gallade have new life, while new contenders like Feraligatr and Annihilape will add major twists to this fan favorite meta.<br><br>Without Giratina or Cresselia in the mix, Poliwrath becomes a major target. Look for Grass and Electric Pokemon like Venusaur, Ampharos, Galvantula, or Lanturn to keep it at bay. Electric in particular has anti-meta potential with the strong number of Water and Flying types available.<br><br>In the mix of them all, Dragon stands out as a defining type for the meta. Shadow Dragonite should remain the pick of choice while several underused options like Dragalge and Goodra could see increased play with the Aqua Tail buff. With Fairy and Steel options looking limited, double Dragon lines could come roaring back from the Ultra Premier of years past. Empoleon is not only one of the best Dragon partners, but also now one of the best Dragon counters with Steel Wing instead of Waterfall. Avoiding the aforementioned Poliwrath will be vital for its success. Good luck! ]]>

			<title>Master League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers for Master League have been updated with training data from the past month. Some of this data precedes the Aqua Tail buff, so Palkia may perform better than the numbers shown. Zygarde/Solgaleo appear to remain top contenders, but the Origin Formes of Dialga and Palkia have proven highly effective after their debut.<br><br>Spring Cup also continues this week, so be on the lookout for a top performers update there as well!]]>
