			<title>Master League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers for Master League have been updated with training data from the past month. Some of this data precedes the Aqua Tail buff, so Palkia may perform better than the numbers shown. Zygarde/Solgaleo appear to remain top contenders, but the Origin Formes of Dialga and Palkia have proven highly effective after their debut.<br><br>Spring Cup also continues this week, so be on the lookout for a top performers update there as well!]]>

			<title>Incineroar Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Incineroar is getting not one but two powerful attacks this weekend during Community Dayâ€”Blast Burn as an exclusive attack, and Darkest Lariat as a regular attack. Which do you want for your Incineroar? Maybe both!<br><br>Incineroar can generate energy quickly with either Snarl or Double Kick, and both Charged Attacks provide immense damage output. Blaze Kick can come in clutch, but Blast Burn isn't that much further to reach. Look to evolve multiple for each league if you want flexibility with your movesets.<br><br>Both attacks are major improvements for Incineroar, although it likely won't rise beyond a spice or themed cup pick with Water types drowning the open metas. Look to make the most of Incineroar in Ultra League, where its combats popular picks like Giratina and Cresselia. Enjoy your Community Day!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers have been updated with an initial look at training analysis for the new meta! Feraligatr is the biggest new kid on the block, and it's been chomping at the bit for a meaningful move update. With Shadow Claw, it's now well on its way to solidifying itself in the meta. Shadow and non-Shadow Feraligatr combine to be top 5 in usage, and their performances have been similar with Shadow slightly edging out non-Shadow. Ice Beam appears to be the secondary move of choice (not enough data was recorded for Crunch).<br><br>With the rise of Feraligatr, Mandibuzz and Guzzlord demonstrated potential thanks to their Shadow Claw resistance. Guzzlord has been an early favorite so far, also resisting Lanturn and Charjabug. Dragon types as a whole have performed well have made a mark on this early meta, with the majority of top teams featuring Dragon leads. The meta is young and there are many opportunities for it to adapt especially as the tournament scene develops.]]>

			<title>Ceruledge and Armarouge Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[This family of fan-favorite Fire types debuts in eggs this coming event. In PvP, they're glass cannon Incinerate users that are viable to play, but they're a step down from Pokemon like Skeledirge or Talonflame.]]>

			<title>Site Updated for World of Wonders</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The website is updated for the new season, World of Wonders! This update includes the new attack changes, and rankings for Electric Cup and Spring Cup.<br><br>The main metas should stay familiar overall. World of Wonders makes some Pokemon more viable than ever before, including Shadow Claw Feraligatr, Steel Wing Empoleon, and Psycho Cut Gallade. Some Dragon types are even stronger, too, with Dragonair, Goodra, and Hakamo-o all receiving buffs.<br><br>Enjoy the new season and good luck with your battles!]]>

			<title>Catch Cup Rankings, Great League Giratina</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted rankings for Great League Catch Cup as well as updated the Little Catch Cup rankings. Both of these use weightings based on usage data to help inform the scoring. Thanks, GO Battle Log!<br><br>In addition, a few legendaries have been introduced to Great League with the latest timed research, including Giratina's Origin forme. It isn't a meta-altering monster like its cousin, but it's still a strong corebreaker with anti-meta potential with resistances to Counter and elemental types. It will require trading to obtain, so make good use of your special trades at meetups and events!]]>

			<title>Little Catch Cup Rankings Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Catch Cup is live, and Little Catch Cup appears to allow all Pokemon at 500 CP or below - including Shuckle and Smeargle. I've updated the rankings with all Pokemon, though note some Pokemon may not be obtainable such as certain Shadows or Legendaries. More so than ever, Little Catch Cup will emphasize which trainers are willing to invest significant resources into the cup's top picks. It's an opportunity to flaunt some fun catches if you have them, but otherwise, regular Catch Cup is still available.]]>

			<title>Dialga Origin and Palkia Origin Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Origin formes of Dialga and Palkia are debuting this weekend! Which should you prioritize for Master League?<br><br>Dialga has long been the meta defining Pokemon for Master League. Its Origin forme has a tradeoff in stats, slightly lower Attack but decently higher Defense and overall more stat product. In addition, Origin Dialga boasts Roar of Time, which is identical to Draco Meteor without the Attack debuff. Altogether, Origin Dialga is a slight improvement over Master League's biggest menace. The head to head matchup is about dead even. The biggest knock against Origin Dialga is that it loses Charged Move ties against its counterpart.<br><br>Palkia isn't meta defining like Dialga, however Origin Palkia is a significant upgrade over regular Palkia. It has both higher Attack and Defense stats, and while Spacial Rend doesn't hit as hard as Draco Meteor, it's a more flexible and accessible nuke. Palkia itself has significant opportunity in the current Master League meta where Landorus, Kyogre, and Ho-oh are popular picks, so its Origin forme should come out swinging.<br><br>If you have already built a Dialga, I recommend focusing on Origin Palkia since it's a more significant upgrade and it will add more depth to your Master League roster. If by chance you haven't built a Dialga yet, I would dedicate your efforts there so you can field Master League's most central Pokemon.]]>

			<title>Enamorus Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Enamorus has finally received stats and moves, and it looks like an aggressive pick in Master League and even Ultra League. This Fairy/Flying type is a glass cannon, but got access to Fairy Wind and Fly for rapid attacks. Its secondary moves include Dazzling Gleam (underwhelming but necessary to hit Dialga) and Grass Knot. Some might find Togekiss to be more reliable, but with that said, Enamorus brings more depth to Master League's Fairy roster and an energy oriented playstyle.]]>

			<title>Little Catch Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted baseline Little Cup rankings to help with initial team building for next week. I'll update these rankings after the cup goes live to weigh them against the most used Pokemon, so expect them to change. (Bronzor is unlikely to move anywhere, however!) I plan to post separate Great League Catch Cup rankings as well, but I'll need to wait after the cup begins so they can factor in which Pokemon players are using most. In the meantime you can use the Great League rankings and ignore Pokemon that aren't available to you. Good luck in your preparations!]]>

			<title>Ultra League Top Performers Updated</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Happy GO Battle Weekend! I've updated the Ultra League top performers with the past few weeks of training data. Annihilape has made a strong debut, placing in the top individual performers and featured on several top teams. Jellicent is seeing a resurgence alongside it, both as a partner and a counter. Check out the list if you need Pokemon or team ideas, and have fun battling!]]>

			<title>Hisuian Decidueye Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Hisuian Decidueye has some interesting pieces, but it's missing just enough to be truly viable. It's a downgrade compared to Chesnaught, lacking both Frenzy Plant and a more desirable Fighting-type attack. Hisuian Decidueye could see play in a future Fighting Cup where Psycho Cut and Aerial Ace give it a leg up on the competition.]]>

			<title>Great League and Hisui Cup Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers with the past week of Great League and Hisui Cup training! In Great League, the meta has continued to establish around Skarmory + Whiscash, and Dewgong tops the individual performers as a result. Dragonair remains a strong player on top teams, most frequently as a neutral lead with a lead-dependent pair in the back, such as Lanturn and Skarmory.<br><br>In Hisui Cup, the meta is focused around a small group including Empoleon, Grastrodon, Drifblim, Toxicroak, and Froslass. Empoleon features on just about all of the top performing teams, most commonly with Froslass or Drifblim as partners. Good luck in the next week of battles!]]>

			<title>Drampa Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Drampa debuts during the Lunar New Year event in raids and field research. Its Normal/Dragon typing gives it unique matchups against Pokemon like Lickitung and Lanturn, but unfortunately its stats and moves are too lacking to make it anything more than spice. Drampa won't be leading the charge, but let the Year of the Dragon commence!]]>
